<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>158</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">DIAMETER<a name="ar1" id="ar1"></a></span> (from the Gr. <span class="grk" title="dia">&#948;&#953;&#940;</span>, through, <span class="grk" title="metron">&#956;&#941;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#957;</span>, measure),
in geometry, a line passing through the centre of a circle or conic
section and terminated by the curve; the &ldquo;principal diameters&rdquo; of the
ellipse and hyperbola coincide with the &ldquo;axes&rdquo; and are at
right angles; &ldquo;conjugate diameters&rdquo; are such that each bisects
chords parallel to the other. The diameter of a quadric surface
is a line at the extremities of which the tangent planes are parallel.
Newton defined the diameter of a curve of any order as the locus
of the centres of the mean distances of the points of intersection
of a system of parallel chords with the curve; this locus may
be shown to be a straight line. The word is also used as a unit
of linear measurement of the magnifying power of a lens or
microscope.</p>

<p>In architecture, the term is used to express the measure of the
lower part of the shaft of a column. It is employed by Vitruvius
(iii. 2) to determine the height of a column, which should vary
from eight to ten diameters according to the intercolumniation:
and it is generally the custom to fix the lower diameter of the
shaft by the height required and the Order employed. Thus
the diameter of the Roman Doric should be about one-eighth of
the height, that of the Ionic one-ninth, and of the Corinthian
one-tenth (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Order</a></span>).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DIAMOND,<a name="ar2" id="ar2"></a></span> a mineral universally recognized as chief among
precious stones; it is the hardest, the most imperishable, and
also the most brilliant of minerals.<a name="fa1a" id="fa1a" href="#ft1a"><span class="sp">1</span></a> These qualities alone
have made it supreme as a jewel since early times, and yet the
real brilliancy of the stone is not displayed until it has been
faceted by the art of the lapidary (<i>q.v.</i>); and this was scarcely
developed before the year 1746. The consummate hardness of
the diamond, in spite of its high price, has made it most useful
for purposes of grinding, polishing and drilling. Numerous
attempts have been made to manufacture the diamond by artificial
means, and these attempts have a high scientific interest on
account of the mystery which surrounds the natural origin of this
remarkable mineral. Its physical and chemical properties have
been the subject of much study, and have a special interest
in view of the extraordinary difference between the physical
characters of the diamond and those of graphite (blacklead) or
charcoal, with which it is chemically identical, and into which it
can be converted by the action of heat or electricity. Again, on
account of the great value of the diamond, much of the romance
of precious stones has centred round this mineral; and the
history of some of the great diamonds of historic times has been
traced through many extraordinary vicissitudes.</p>

<p>The name <span class="grk" title="Adamas">&#902;&#948;&#940;&#956;&#945;&#962;</span>, &ldquo;the invincible,&rdquo; was probably applied by
the Greeks to hard metals, and thence to corundum (emery) and
other hard stones. According to Charles William King, the first
undoubted application of the name to the diamond is found
in Manilius (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 16),&mdash;<i>Sic Adamas</i>, <i>punctum lapidis</i>, <i>pretiosior
auro</i>,&mdash;and Pliny (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 100) speaks of the rarity of the stone,
&ldquo;the most valuable of gems, known only to kings.&rdquo; Pliny described
six varieties, among which the Indian, having six pointed
angles, and also resembling two pyramids (<i>turbines</i>, whip-tops)
placed base to base, may probably be identified as the ordinary
octahedral crystal (fig. 1). The &ldquo;diamond&rdquo; (<i>Yahalom</i>) in the
breastplate of the high priest (Ex. xxxix. 11) was certainly some
other stone, for it bore the name of a tribe, and methods of
engraving the true diamond cannot have been known so early.
The stone can hardly have become familiar to the Romans until
introduced from India, where it was probably mined at a very
early period. But one or other of the remaining varieties
mentioned by Pliny (the Macedonian, the Arabian, the Cyprian,
&amp;c.) may be the true diamond, which was in great request for
the tool of the gem-engraver. Later Roman authors mentioned
various rivers in India as yielding the <i>Adamas</i> among their sands.
The name <i>Adamas</i> became corrupted into the forms <i>adamant</i>,
<i>diamaunt</i>, <i>diamant</i>, <i>diamond</i>; but the same word, owing to
a medieval misinterpretation which derived it from <i>adamare</i>
(compare the French word <i>aimant</i>), was also applied to the
lodestone.</p>

<p>Like all the precious stones, the diamond was credited with
many marvellous virtues; among others the power of averting
insanity, and of rendering poison harmless; and in the middle
ages it was known as the &ldquo;pietra della reconciliazione,&rdquo; as the
peacemaker between husband and wife.</p>

<p><i>Scientific Characters.</i>&mdash;The majority of minerals are found most
commonly in masses which can with difficulty be recognized as
aggregates of crystalline grains, and occur comparatively seldom
as distinct crystals; but the diamond is almost always found
in single crystals, which show no signs of previous attachment to
any matrix; the stones were, until the discovery of the South
African mines, almost entirely derived from sands or gravels,
but owing to the hardness of the mineral it is rarely, if ever,
water-worn, and the crystals are often very perfect. The crystals
belong to the cubic system, generally assuming the form of the
octahedron (fig. 1), but they may, in accordance with the principles
of crystallography, also occur in other forms symmetrically
derived from the octahedron,&mdash;for example, the cube, the
12-faced figure known as the rhombic dodecahedron (fig. 2), or
the 48-faced figure known as the hexakis-octahedron (fig. 3), or
in combinations of these. The octahedron faces are usually
smooth; most of the other faces are rounded (fig. 4). The cube
faces are rough with protruding points. The cube is sometimes
found in Brazil, but is very rare among the S. African stones;
and the dodecahedron is perhaps more
common in Brazil than elsewhere.
There is often a furrow running along
the edges of the octahedron, or across
the edges of the cube, and this indicates
that the apparently simple crystal may
really consist of eight individuals meeting
at the centre; or, what comes to the
same thing, of two individuals interpenetrating
and projecting through
each other. If this be so the form of the diamond is really the
tetrahedron (and the various figures derived symmetrically from
it) and not the <span class="correction" title="amended from octadehron">octahedron</span> Fig. 5 shows
how the octahedron with furrowed edge
may be constructed from two interpenetrating
tetrahedra (shown in dotted lines).
If the grooves be left out of account, the
large faces which have replaced each tetrahedron
corner then make up a figure which
has the aspect of a simple octahedron.
Such regular interpenetrations are known
in crystallography as &ldquo;twins.&rdquo; There are also twins of diamond
in which two octahedra (fig. 6) are united by contact along
a surface parallel to an octahedron face without interpenetration.
On account of their resemblance to
the twins of the mineral spinel (which
crystallizes in octahedra) these are
known as &ldquo;spinel twins.&rdquo; They are generally
flattened along the plane of union.
The crystals often display triangular
markings, either elevations or pits, upon
the octahedron faces; the latter are
particularly well defined and have the form
of equilateral triangles (fig. 7). They are
similar to the &ldquo;etched figures&rdquo; produced
by moistening an octahedron of alum, and have probably been
produced, like them, by the action of some solvent. Similar, but
somewhat different markings are produced by the combustion
of diamond in oxygen, unaccompanied by any rounding of the
edges.</p>

<p>Diamond possesses a brilliant &ldquo;adamantine&rdquo; lustre, but this
tends to be greasy on the surface of the natural stones and gives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>159</span>
the rounded crystals somewhat the appearance of drops of gum.
Absolutely colourless stones are not so common as cloudy and
faintly coloured specimens; the usual tints are grey, brown,
yellow or white; and as rarities, red, green, blue and black
stones have been found. The colour can sometimes be removed
or changed at a high temperature, but generally returns on
cooling. It is therefore more probably due to metallic oxides than
to hydrocarbons. Sir William Crookes has, however, changed
a pale yellow diamond to a bluish-green colour by keeping it
embedded in radium bromide for eleven weeks. The black
coloration upon the surface produced by this process, as also by
the electric bombardment in a vacuum tube, appears to be due
to a conversion of the surface film into graphite. Diamond may
break with a conchoidal fracture, but the crystals always cleave
readily along planes parallel to the octahedron faces: of this
property the diamond cutters avail themselves when reducing
the stone to the most convenient form for cutting; a sawing
process, has, however, now been introduced, which is preferable
to that of cleavage. It is the hardest known substance (though
tantalum, or an alloy of tantalum now competes with it) and is
chosen as 10 in the mineralogist&rsquo;s scale of hardness; but the
difference in hardness between diamond (10) and corundum (9)
is really greater than that between corundum (9) and talc (1);
there is a difference in the hardness of the different faces; the
Borneo stones are also said to be harder than those of Australia,
and the Australian harder than the African, but this is by no
means certain. The specific gravity ranges from 3.56 to 3.50,
generally about 3.52. The coefficient of expansion increases very
rapidly above 750°, and diminishes very rapidly at low temperatures;
the maximum density is attained about &minus;42° C.</p>

<p>The very high refractive power (index = 2.417 for sodium light)
gives the stone its extraordinary brilliancy; for light incident
within a diamond at a greater angle than 24½° is reflected back
into the stone instead of passing through it; the corresponding
angle for glass is 40½°. The very high dispersion (index for red
light = 2.402, for blue light = 2.460) gives it the wonderful &ldquo;fire&rdquo;
or display of spectral colours. Certain absorption bands at the
blue end of the spectrum are supposed to be due to rare elements
such as samarium. Unlike other cubic crystals, diamond
experiences a diminution of refractive index with increase of
temperature. It is very transparent for Röntgen rays, whereas
paste imitations are opaque. It is a good conductor of heat, and
therefore feels colder to the touch than glass and imitation stones.
The diamond has also a somewhat greasy feel. The specific heat
increases rapidly with rising temperature up to 60° C., and then
more slowly. Crystals belonging to the cubic system should not
be birefringent unless strained; diamond often displays double
refraction particularly in the neighbourhood of inclusions, both
liquid and solid; this is probably due to strain, and the
spontaneous explosion of diamonds has often been observed.
Diamond differs from graphite in being a bad conductor of
electricity: it becomes positively electrified by friction. The
electrical resistance is about that of ordinary glass, and is
diminished by one-half during exposure by Röntgen rays; the
dielectric constant (16) is greater than that which should
correspond to the specific gravity.</p>

<p>The phosphorescence produced by friction has been known
since the time of Robert Boyle (1663); the diamond becomes
luminous in a dark room after exposure to sunlight or in the
presence of radium; and many stones phosphoresce beautifully
(generally with a pale green light) when subjected to the electric
discharge in a vacuum tube. Some diamonds are more phosphorescent
than others, and different faces of a crystal may display
different tints. The combustibility of the diamond was predicted
by Sir Isaac Newton on account of its high refractive
power; it was first established experimentally by the Florentine
Academicians in 1694. In oxygen or air diamond burns at about
850°, and only continues to do so if maintained at a high temperature;
but in the absence of oxidising agents it may be raised
to a much higher temperature. It is, however, infusible at
the temperature of the electric arc, but becomes converted
superficially into graphite. Experiments on the combustion of
diamond were made by Smithson Tennant (1797) and Sir
Humphry Davy (1816), with the object of proving that it is pure
carbon; they showed that burnt in oxygen it yields exactly the
same amount of carbon dioxide as that produced by burning the
same weight of carbon. Still more convincing experiments were
made by A. Krause in 1890. Similarly Guyton de Morveau
showed that, like charcoal, diamond converts soft iron into steel.
Diamond is insoluble in acid and alkalis, but is oxidised on
heating with potassium bichromate and sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>Bort (or Boart) is the name given to impure crystals or fragments
useless for jewels; it is also applied to the rounded
crystalline aggregates, which generally have a grey colour,
a rough surface, often a radial structure, and are devoid of
good cleavage. They are sometimes spherical (&ldquo;shot bort&rdquo;).
Carbonado or &ldquo;black diamond,&rdquo; found in Bahia (also recently
in Minas Geraes), is a black material with a minutely crystalline
structure somewhat porous, opaque, resembling charcoal in
appearance, devoid of cleavage, rather harder than diamond,
but of less specific gravity; it sometimes displays a rude cubic
crystalline form. The largest specimen found (1895) weighed
3078 carats. Both bort and carbonado seem to be really aggregates
of crystallized diamond, but the carbonado is so nearly
structureless that it was till recently regarded as an amorphous
modification of carbon.</p>

<p><i>Uses of the Diamond.</i>&mdash;The use of the diamond for other
purposes than jewelry depends upon its extreme hardness: it
has always been the only material used for cutting or engraving
the diamond itself. The employment of powdered bort and
the lapidary&rsquo;s wheel for faceting diamonds was introduced by
L. von Berquen of Bruges in 1476. Diamonds are now employed
not only for faceting precious stones, but also for cutting and
drilling glass, porcelain, &amp;c,; for fine engraving such as scales;
in dentistry for drilling; as a turning tool for electric-light
carbons, hard rubber, &amp;c.; and occasionally for finishing accurate
turning work such as the axle of a transit instrument. For these
tools the stone is actually shaped to the best form: it is now
electroplated before being set in its metal mount in order to
secure a firm fastening. It is also used for bearings in watches
and electric meters. The best glaziers&rsquo; diamonds are chosen from
crystals such that a natural curved edge can be used. For rock
drills, and revolving saws for stone cutting, either diamond, bort
or carbonado is employed, set in steel tubes, disks or bands. Rock
drilling is the most important industrial application; and for
this, owing to its freedom from cleavage, the carbonado is more
highly prized than diamond; it is broken into fragments about
3 carats in weight; and in 1905 the value of carbonado was no
less than from £10 to £14 a carat. It has been found that the
&ldquo;carbons&rdquo; in drills can safely be subjected to a pressure of over
60 kilograms per square millimetre, and a speed of 25 metres
per second. A recent application of the diamond is for wire
drawing; a hole tapering towards the centre is drilled through
a diamond, and the metal is drawn through this. No other tool
is so endurable, or gives such uniform thickness of wire.</p>

<p><i>Distribution and Mining.</i>&mdash;The most important localities for
diamonds have been: (1) India, where they were mined from
the earliest times till the close of the 19th century; (2) South
America, where they have been mined since the middle of the
18th century; and (3) South Africa, to which almost the whole
of the diamond-mining industry has been transferred since 1870.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>India.</i>&mdash;The diamond is here found in ancient sandstones and conglomerates,
and in the river gravels and sands derived from them.
The sandstones and conglomerates belong to the Vindhyan formation
and overlie the old crystalline rocks: the diamantiferous beds are
well defined, often not more than 1 ft. in thickness, and contain
pebbles of quartzite, jasper, sandstone, slate, &amp;c. The mines fall
into five groups situated on the eastern side of the Deccan plateau
about the following places (beginning from the south), the first three
being in Madras. (1) Chennur near Cuddapah on the river Pennar.
(2) Kurnool near Baneganapalle between the rivers Pennar and
Kistna. (3) Kollar near Bezwada on the river Kistna. (4) Sambalpur
on the river Mahanadi in the Central Provinces. (5) Panna near
Allahabad, in Bundelkhand. The mining has always been carried
on by natives of low caste, and by primitive methods which do not
differ much from those described by the French merchant Jean
Baptiste Tavernier (1605-1689), who paid a prolonged visit to most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>160</span>
of the mines between 1638 and 1665 as a dealer in precious stones.
According to his description shallow pits were sunk, and the gravel
excavated was gathered into a walled enclosure where it was crushed
and water was poured over it, and it was finally sifted in baskets and
sorted by hand. The buying and selling was at that period conducted
by young children. In more modern times there has been the same
excavation of shallow pits, and sluicing, sifting and sorting, by hand
labour, the only machinery used being chain pumps made of earthen
bowls to remove the water from the deeper pits.</p>

<p>At some of the Indian localities spasmodic mining has been carried
on at different periods for centuries, at some the work which had been
long abandoned was revived in recent times, at others it has long been
abandoned altogether. Many of the large stones of antiquity were
probably found in the Kollar group, where Tavernier found 60,000
workers in 1645 (?), the mines having, according to native accounts,
been discovered about 100 years previously. Golconda was the
fortress and the market for the diamond industry at this group of
mines, and so gave its name to them. The old mines have now been
completely abandoned, but in 1891 about 1000 carats were being
raised annually in the neighbourhood of Hyderabad. The Sambalpur
group appear to have been the most ancient mines of all, but they
were not worked later than 1850. The Panna group were the most
productive during the 19th century. India was no doubt the source
of all the large stones of antiquity; a stone of 67<span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> carats was found
at Wajra Karur in the Chennur group in 1881, and one of 210½
carats at Hira Khund in 1809. Other Indian localities besides those
mentioned above are Simla, in the N.W. Provinces, where a few
stones have been found, and a district on the Gouel and the Sunk
rivers in Bengal, which V. Ball has identified with the Soumelpour
mentioned by Tavernier. The mines of Golconda and Kurnool were
described as early as 1677 in the twelfth volume of the <i>Philosophical
Transactions</i> of the Royal Society. At the present time very few
Indian diamonds find their way out of the country, and, so far as
the world&rsquo;s supply is concerned, Indian mining of diamonds may be
considered extinct. The first blow to this industry was the discovery
of the Brazilian mines in Minas Geraes and Bahia.</p>

<p><i>Brazil.</i>&mdash;-Diamonds were found about 1725 at Tejuco (now Diamantina)
in Minas Geraes, and the mining became important about
1740. The chief districts in Minas Geraes are (1) Bagagem on the W.
side of the Serra da Mata da Corda; (2) Rio Abaete on the E. side of
the same range; these two districts being among the head waters of
the Rio de San Francisco and its tributaries; (3) Diamantina, on and
about the watershed separating the Rio de San Francisco from the
Rio Jequitinhonha; and (4) Grao Mogul, nearly 200 m. to the N.E.
of Diamantina on the latter river.</p>

<p>The Rio Abaete district was worked on a considerable scale between
1785 and 1807, but is now abandoned. Diamantina is at present the
most important district; it occupies a mountainous plateau, and
the diamonds are found both on the plateau and in the river valleys
below it. The mountains consist here of an ancient laminated
micaceous quartzite, which is in parts a flexible sandstone known as
itacolumite, and in parts a conglomerate; it is interbedded with
clay-slate, mica-schist, hornblende-schist and haematite-schist, and
intersected by veins of quartz. This series is overlain unconformably
by a younger quartzite of similar character, and itself rests upon the
crystalline schists. The diamond is found under three conditions:
(1) in the gravels of the present rivers, embedded in a ferruginous clay-cemented
conglomerate known as <i>cascalho</i>; (2) in terraces (gupiarras)
in a similar conglomerate occupying higher levels in the present
valleys; (3) in plateau deposits in a coarse surface conglomerate
known as <i>gurgulho</i>, the diamond and other heavy minerals being
embedded in the red clay which cements the larger blocks. Under
all these three conditions the diamond is associated with fragments
of the rocks of the country and the minerals derived from them,
especially quartz, hornstone, jasper, the polymorphous oxide of
titanium (rutile, anatase and brookite), oxides and hydrates of iron
(magnetite, ilmenite, haematite, limonite), oxide of tin, iron pyrites,
tourmaline, garnet, xenotime, monazite, kyanite, diaspore, sphene,
topaz, and several phosphates, and also gold. Since the heavy
minerals of the <i>cascalho</i> in the river beds are more worn than those of
the terraces, it is highly probable that they have been derived by the
cutting down of the older river gravels represented by the terraces;
and since in both deposits the heavy minerals are more abundant
near the heads of the valleys in the plateau, it is also highly probable
that both have really been derived from the plateau deposit. In the
latter, especially at São João da Chapada, the minerals accompanying
the diamond are scarcely worn at all; in the terraces and the river
beds they are more worn and more abundant; the terraces, therefore,
are to be regarded as a first concentration of the plateau material by
the old rivers; and the <i>cascalho</i> as a second concentration by the
modern rivers. The mining is carried on by negroes under the supervision
of overseers; the <i>cascalho</i> is dug out in the dry season and
removed to a higher level, and is afterwards washed out by hand in
running water in shallow wooden basins (<i>bateas</i>). The terraces can
be worked at all seasons, and the material is partly washed out
by leading streams on to it. The washing of the plateau material is
effected in reservoirs of rain water.</p>

<p>It is difficult to obtain an estimate of the actual production of the
Minas Geraes mines, for no official returns have been published, but
in recent years it has certainly been rivalled by the yield in Bahia.
The diamond here occurs in river gravels and sands associated with
the same minerals as in Minas Geraes; since 1844 the richest mines
have been worked in the Serra de Cincora, where the mountains are
intersected by the river Paraguassu and its tributaries; it is said
that there were as many as 20,000 miners working here in 1845, and
it was estimated that 54,000 carats were produced in Bahia in 1858.
The earlier workings were in the Serra de Chapada to the N.W. of
the mines just mentioned. In 1901 there were about 5000 negroes
employed in the Bahia mines; methods were still primitive; the
<i>cascalho</i> was dug out from the river beds or tunnelled out from the
valley side, and washed once a week in sluices of running water,
where it was turned over with the hoe, and finally washed in wooden
basins and picked over by hand; sometimes also the diamantiferous
material is scooped out of the bed of the shallow rivers by divers, and
by men working under water in caissons. It is almost exclusively in
the mines of Bahia, and in particular in the Cincora district, that the
valuable carbonado is found. The carbonado and the diamond have
been traced to an extensive hard conglomerate which occurs in the
middle of the sandstone formation. Diamonds are also mined at
Salobro on the river Pardo not far inland from the port of Canavieras
in the S.E. corner of Bahia. The enormous development of the South
African mines, which supplied in 1906, about 90% of the world&rsquo;s produce,
has thrown into the shade the Brazilian production; but the <i>Bulletin</i>
for Feb. 1909 of the International Bureau of American Republics gave
a very confident account of its future, under improved methods.</p>

<p><i>South Africa.</i>&mdash;-The first discovery was made in 1867 by Dr W. G.
Atherstone, who identified as diamond a pebble obtained from a
child in a farm on the banks of the Orange river and brought by a
trader to Grahamstown; it was bought for £500 and displayed in the
Paris Exhibition of that year. In 1869 a stone weighing 83½ carats
was found near the Orange river; this was purchased by the earl
of Dudley for £25,000 and became famous as the &ldquo;Star of South
Africa.&rdquo; A rush of prospectors at once took place to the banks of
the Orange and Vaal rivers, and resulted in considerable discoveries, so
that in 1870 there was a mining camp of no less than 10,000 persons
on the &ldquo;River Diggings.&rdquo; In the River Diggings the mining was
carried on in the coarse river gravels, and by the methods of the
Brazilian negroes and of gold placer-miners. A diggers&rsquo; committee
limited the size of claims to 30 ft. square, with free access to the river
bank; the gravel and sand were washed in cradles provided with
screens of perforated metal, and the concentrates were sorted by
hand on tables by means of an iron scraper.</p>

<p>But towards the close of 1870 stones were found at Jagersfontein
and at Dutoitspan, far from the Vaal river, and led to a second great
rush of prospectors, especially to Dutoitspan, and in 1871 to what
is now the Kimberley mine in the neighbourhood of the latter. At
each of these spots the diamantiferous area was a roughly circular
patch of considerable size, and in some occupied the position of
one of those depressions or &ldquo;pans&rdquo; so frequent in S. Africa. These
&ldquo;dry diggings&rdquo; were therefore at first supposed to be alluvial in origin
like the river gravels; but it was soon discovered that, below the red
surface soil and the underlying calcareous deposit, diamonds were also
found in a layer of yellowish clay about 50 ft. thick known as &ldquo;yellow
ground.&rdquo; Below this again was a hard bluish-green serpentinous rock
which was at first supposed to be barren bed-rock; but this also
contained the precious stone, and has become famous, under the
name of &ldquo;blue ground,&rdquo; as the matrix of the S. African diamonds.
The yellow ground is merely decomposed blue ground. In the
Kimberley district five of these round patches of blue ground were
found within an area little more than 3 m. in diameter; that at
Kimberley occupying 10 acres, that at Dutoitspan 23 acres. There
were soon 50,000 workers on this field, the canvas camp was replaced
by a town of brick and iron surrounded by the wooden huts of the
natives, and Kimberley became an important centre.</p>

<p>It was soon found that each mine was in reality a huge vertical
funnel or crater descending to an unknown depth, and filled with
diamantiferous blue ground. At first each claim was an independent
pit 31 ft. square sunk into the blue ground; the diamantiferous rock
was hoisted by bucket and windlass, and roadways were left across
the pit to provide access to the claims. But the roadways soon fell
in, and ultimately haulage from the claims could only be provided by
means of a vast system of wire ropes extending from a triple staging
of windlasses erected round the entire edge of the mine, which had by
this time become a huge open pit; the ropes from the upper windlasses
extended to the centre, and those from the lower tier to the
sides of the pit; covering the whole mass like a gigantic cobweb.
(See Plate II. fig. 12.) The buckets of blue ground were hauled up
these ropes by means of horse whims, and in 1875 steam winding
engines began to be employed. By this time also improved methods
in the treatment of the blue ground were introduced. It was carried
off in carts to open spaces, where an exposure of some weeks to the air
was found to pulverize the hard rock far more efficiently than the
old method of crushing with mallets. The placer-miner&rsquo;s cradle and
rocking-trough were replaced by puddling troughs stirred by a
revolving comb worked by horse power; reservoirs were constructed
for the scanty water-supply, bucket elevators were introduced to
carry away the tailings; and the natives were confined in compounds.
For these improvements co-operation was necessary; the better
claims, which in 1872 had risen from £100 to more than £4000 in
value, began to be consolidated, and a Mining Board was introduced.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In a very few years, however, the open pit mining was rendered
impossible by the mud rushes, by the falls of the masses of barren
rock known as &ldquo;reef,&rdquo; which were left standing in the mine, and by
landslips from the sides, so that in 1883, when the pit had reached a
depth of about 400 ft., mining in the Kimberley crater had become
almost impossible. By 1889, in the whole group of mines, Kimberley,
Dutoitspan, De Beers and Bultfontein, open pit working was practically
abandoned. Meanwhile mining below the bottom of the pits by
means of shafts and underground tunnels had been commenced; but
the full development of modern methods dates from the year 1889
when Cecil Rhodes and Alfred Beit, who had already secured control
of the De Beers mine, acquired also the control of the Kimberley mine,
and shortly afterwards consolidated the entire group in the hands of
the De Beers Company. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Kimberley</a></span>.)</p>

<p>The scene of native mining was now transferred from the open pit
to underground tunnels; the vast network of wire ropes (Plate II.
fig. 12) with their ascending and descending buckets disappeared, and
with it the cosmopolitan crowd of busy miners working like ants at
the bottom of the pit. In place of all this, the visitor to Kimberley
encounters at the edge of the town only a huge crater,
silent and apparently deserted, with no visible sign of the
great mining operations which are conducted nearly half
a mile below the surface. The aspect of the Kimberley
pit in 1906 is shown in fig. 13 of Plate II., which may
be compared with the section of fig. 8.</p>

<p>In fig. 13, Plate II., the sequence of the basalt, shale and
melaphyre is clearly visible on the sides of the pit; and
fig. 8 shows how the crater or &ldquo;pipe&rdquo; of blue ground has
penetrated these rocks and also the underlying quartzite.
The workings at De Beers had extended into the still
more deeply seated granite in 1906. Figure 9, Plate I.,
shows the top of the De Beers&rsquo; crater with basalt overlying
the shale. Figure 8 also explains the modern
system of mining introduced by Gardner Williams. A
vertical shaft is sunk in the vicinity of the mine, and from
this horizontal tunnels are driven into the pipe at different
levels separated by intervals of 40 ft. Through the
blue ground itself on each level a series of parallel tunnels
about 120 ft. apart are driven to the opposite side of the
pipe, and at right angles to these, and 36 ft. apart,
another series of tunnels. When the tunnels reach the
side of the mine they are opened upwards and sideways
so as to form a large chamber, and the overlying mass of
blue ground and débris is allowed to settle down and fill
up the gallery. On each level this process is carried
somewhat farther back than on the level below (fig. 8);
material is thus continually withdrawn from one side of
the mine and extracted by means of the rock shaft on the
opposite side, while the superincumbent débris is continually
sinking, and is allowed to fall deeper on the side
farthest from the shaft as the blue ground is withdrawn
from beneath it. In 1905 the main shaft had been sunk
to a depth of 2600 ft. at the Kimberley mine.</p>

<p>For the extraction and treatment of the blue ground
the De Beers Company in its great winding and washing plant employs
labour-saving machinery on a gigantic scale. The ground is
transferred in trucks to the shaft where it is automatically tipped into
skips holding 96 cubic ft. (six truck loads); these are rapidly hoisted
to the surface, where their contents are automatically dumped into
side-tipping trucks, and these in turn are drawn away in a continual
procession by an endless wire rope along the tram lines leading to the
vast &ldquo;distributing floors.&rdquo; These are open tracts upon which the blue
ground is spread out and left exposed to sun and rain until it crumbles
and disintegrates, the process being hastened by harrowing with
steam ploughs; this may require a period of three or six months, or
even a year. The stock of blue ground on the floors at one time in
1905 was nearly 4,500,000 loads. The disintegrated ground is then
brought back in the trucks and fed through perforated cylinders into
the washing pans; the hard blue which has resisted disintegration
on the floors, and the lumps which are too big to pass the cylindrical
sieves, are crushed before going to the pans. These are shallow
cylindrical troughs containing muddy water in which the diamonds
and other heavy minerals (concentrates) are swept to the rim by
revolving toothed arms, while the lighter stuff escapes near the centre
of the pan. The concentrates are then passed over sloping tables
(pulsator) and shaken to and fro under a stream of water which effects
a second concentration of the heaviest material.</p>

<p>Until recently the final separation of the diamond from the concentrates
was made by hand picking, but even this has now been
replaced by machinery, owing to the remarkable discovery that a
greased surface will hold a diamond while allowing the other heavy
minerals to pass over it. The concentrates are washed down a sloping
table of corrugated iron which is smeared with grease, and it is found
that practically all the diamonds adhere to the table, and the other
minerals are washed away. At the large and important Premier mine
in the Transvaal the Elmore process, used in British Columbia and
in Wales for the separation of metallic ores, has been also introduced.
In the Elmore process oil is employed to float off the materials which
adhere to it, while the other materials remain in the water, the oil
being separated from the water by centrifugal action. The other
minerals found in the concentrates are pebbles and fragments of
pyrope, zircon, cyanite, chrome-diopside, enstatite, a green pyroxene,
mica, ilmenite, magnetite, chromite, hornblende, olivine, barytes,
calcite and pyrites.</p>

<p>In all the S. African mines the diamonds are not only crystals of
various weights from fractions of a carat to 150 carats, but also occur
as microscopic crystals disseminated through the blue ground. In
spite of this, however, the average yield in the profitable mines is
only from 0.2 carat to 0.6 carat per load of 1600 lb, or on an average
about 1½ grs. per ton. The annual output of diamonds from the De
Beers mines was valued in 1906 at nearly £5,000,000; the value per
carat ranging from about 35s. to 70s.</p>

<p>Pipes similar to those which surround Kimberley have been found
in other parts of S. Africa. One of the best known is that of Jagersfontein,
which was really the first of the dry diggings (discovered in
1870). This large mine is near Fauresmith and 80 m. to the south
of Kimberley. In 1905 the year&rsquo;s production from the Orange River
Colony mines was more than 320,000 carats, valued at £938,000. But
by far the largest of all the pipes hitherto discovered is the Premier
mine in the Transvaal, about 300 m. to the east of Kimberley. This
was discovered in 1902 and occupies an area of about 75 acres. In
1906 it was being worked as a shallow open mine; but the description
of the Kimberley methods given above is applicable to the washing
plant at that time being introduced into the Premier mine upon a very
large scale. Comparatively few of the pipes which have been discovered
are at all rich in diamonds, and many are quite barren; some
are filled with &ldquo;hard blue&rdquo; which even if diamantiferous may be
too expensive to work.</p>

<p>The most competent S. African geologists believe all these remarkable
pipes to be connected with volcanic outbursts which occurred
over the whole of S. Africa during the Cretaceous period (after the
deposition of the Stormberg beds), and drilled these enormous craters
through all the later formations. With the true pipes are associated
dykes and fissures also filled with diamantiferous blue ground. It
is only in the more northerly part of the country that the pipes
are filled with blue ground (or &ldquo;kimberlite&rdquo;), and that they are
diamantiferous; but over a great part of Cape Colony have been
discovered what are probably similar pipes filled with agglomerates,
breccias and tuffs, and some with basic lavas; one, in particular, in
the Riversdale Division near the southern coast, being occupied by a
melilite-basalt. It is quite clear that the occurrence of the diamond
in the S. African pipes is quite different from the occurrences in
alluvial deposits which have been described above. The question of
the origin of the diamond in S. Africa and elsewhere is discussed
below.</p>

<p>The River Diggings on the Vaal river are still worked upon a small
scale, but the production from this source is so limited that they are
of little account in comparison with the mines in the blue ground.
The stones, however, are good; since they differ somewhat from the
Kimberley crystals it is probable that they were not derived from
the present pipes. Another S. African locality must be mentioned;
considerable finds were reported in 1905 and 1906 from gravels
at Somabula near Gwelo in Rhodesia where the diamond is associated
with chrysoberyl, corundum (both sapphire and ruby), topaz,
garnet, ilmenite, staurolite, rutile, with pebbles of quartz, granite,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>162</span>
chlorite-schist, &amp;c. Diamond has also been reported from kimberlite
&ldquo;pipes&rdquo; in Rhodesia.</p>

<p><i>Other Localities.</i>&mdash;In addition to the South American localities
mentioned above, small diamonds have also been mined since their
discovery in 1890 on the river Mazaruni in British Guiana, and
finds have been reported in the gold washings of Dutch Guiana.
Borneo has possessed a diamond industry since the island was first
settled by the Malays; the references in the works of Garcia de Orta,
Linschoten, De Boot, De Laet and others, to Malacca as a locality
relate to Borneo. The large Borneo stone, over 360 carats in weight,
known as the Matan, is in all probability not a diamond. The chief
mines are situated on the river Kapuas in the west and near
Bandjarmassin in the south-east of the island, and the alluvial
deposits in which they occur are worked by a small number of Chinese
and Malays. Australia has yielded diamonds in alluvial deposits
near Bathurst (where the first discovery was made in 1851) and
Mudgee in New South Wales, and also near Bingara and Inverell
in the north of the colony. At Mount Werong a stone weighing
29 carats was found in 1905. At Ruby Hill near Bingara they were
found in a breccia filling a volcanic pipe. At Ballina, in New England,
diamonds have been found in the sea sand. Other Australian
localities are Echunga in South Australia; Beechworth, Arena and
Melbourne in Victoria; Freemantle and Nullagine in Western
Australia; the Palmer and Gilbert rivers in Queensland. These have
been for the most part discoveries in alluvial deposits of the goldfields,
and the stones were small. In Tasmania also diamonds have
been found in the Corinna goldfields. Europe has produced few
diamonds. Humboldt searched for them in the Urals on account of
the similarity of the gold and platinum deposits to those of Brazil,
and small diamonds were ultimately found (1829) in the gold washings
of Bissersk, and later at Ekaterinburg and other spots in the Urals.
In Lapland they have been found in the sands of the Pasevig river.
Siberia has yielded isolated diamonds from the gold washings of
Yenisei. In North America a few small stones have been found in
alluvial deposits, mostly auriferous, in Georgia, N. and S. Carolina,
Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee, Wisconsin, California, Oregon and
Indiana. A crystal weighing 23¾ carats was found in Virginia in
1855, and one of 21¼ carats in Wisconsin in 1886. In 1906 a number
of small diamonds were discovered in an altered peridotite somewhat
resembling the S. African blue ground, at Murfreesboro, Pike
county, Arkansas. Considerable interest attaches to the diamonds
found in Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio near the Great Lakes, for they
are here found in the terminal moraines of the great glacial sheet which
is supposed to have spread southwards from the region of Hudson
Bay; several of the drift minerals of the diamantiferous region of
Indiana have been identified as probably of Canadian origin; no
diamonds have however yet been found in the intervening country of
Ontario. A rock similar to the blue ground of Kimberley has been
found in the states of Kentucky and New York. The occurrence of
diamond in meteorites is described below.</p>

<p><i>Origin of the Diamond in Nature.</i>&mdash;It appears from the foregoing
account that at most localities the diamond is found in alluvial deposits
probably far from the place where it originated. The minerals
associated with it do not afford much clue to the original conditions;
they are mostly heavy minerals derived from the neighbouring rocks,
in which the diamond itself has not been observed. Among the
commonest associates of the diamond are quartz, topaz, tourmaline,
rutile, zircon, magnetite, garnet, spinel and other minerals which are
common accessory constituents of granite, gneiss and the crystalline
schists. Gold (also platinum) is a not infrequent associate, but this
may only mean that the sands in which the diamond is found have
been searched because they were known to be auriferous; also that
both gold and diamond are among the most durable of minerals and
may have survived from ancient rocks of which other traces have been
lost.</p>

<p>The localities at which the diamond has been supposed to occur
in its original matrix are the following:&mdash;at Wajra Karur, in the
Cuddapah district, India, M. Chaper found diamond with corundum
in a decomposed red pegmatite vein in gneiss. At S&#257;o João da
Chapada, in Minas Geraes, diamonds occur in a clay interstratified
with the itacolumite, and are accompanied by sharp crystals of rutile
and haematite in the neighbourhood of decomposed quartz veins
which intersect the itacolumite. It has been suggested that these
three minerals were originally formed in the quartz veins. In both
these occurrences the evidence is certainly not sufficient to establish
the presence of an original matrix. At Inverell in New South Wales
a diamond (1906) has been found embedded in a hornblende diabase
which is described as a dyke intersecting the granite. Finally there is
the remarkable occurrence in the blue ground of the African pipes.</p>

<p>There has been much controversy concerning the nature and origin
of the blue ground itself; and even granted that (as is generally
believed) the blue ground is a much serpentinized volcanic breccia
consisting originally of an olivine-bronzite-biotite rock (the so-called
kimberlite), it contains so many rounded and angular fragments of
various rocks and minerals that it is difficult to say which of them
may have belonged to the original rock, and whether any were formed
<i>in situ</i>, or were brought up from below as inclusions. Carvill Lewis
believed the blue ground to be true eruptive rock, and the carbon to
have been derived from the bituminous shales of which it contains
fragments. The Kimberley shales, which are penetrated by the De
Beers group of pipes, were, however, certainly not the source of the
carbon at the Premier (Transvaal) mine, for at this locality the shales
do not exist. The view that the diamond may have crystallized out
from solution in its present matrix receives some support from the
experiments of W. Luzi, who found that it can be corroded by the
solvent action of fused blue ground; from the experiments of
J. Friedländer, who obtained diamond by dissolving graphite in fused
olivine; and still more from the experiments of R. von Hasslinger
and J. Wolff, who have obtained it by dissolving graphite in a fused
mixture of silicates having approximately the composition of the
blue ground. E. Cohen, who regarded the pipes as of the nature of a
mud volcano, and the blue ground as a kimberlite breccia altered by
hydrothermal action, thought that the diamond and accompanying
minerals had been brought up from deep-seated crystalline schists.
Other authors have sought the origin of the diamond in the action
of the hydrated magnesian silicates on hydrocarbons derived from
bituminous schists, or in the decomposition of metallic carbides.</p>

<p>Of great scientific interest in this connexion is the discovery of
small diamonds in certain meteorites, both stones and irons; for
example, in the stone which fell at Novo-Urei in Penza, Russia, in
1886, in a stone found at Carcote in Chile, and in the iron found at
Cañon Diablo in Arizona. Graphitic carbon in cubic form (cliftonite)
has also been found in certain meteoric &ldquo;irons,&rdquo; for example in those
from Magura in Szepes county, Hungary, and Youndegin near York
in Western Australia. The latter is now generally believed to be
altered diamond. The fact that H. Moissan has produced the
diamond artificially, by allowing dissolved carbon to crystallize out
at a high temperature and pressure from molten iron, coupled with
the occurrence in meteoric iron, has led Sir William Crookes and others
to conclude that the mineral may have been derived from deep-seated
iron containing carbon in solution (see the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Gem, Artificial</a></span>).
Adolf Knop suggested that this may have first yielded hydrocarbons
by contact with water, and that from these the crystalline diamond
has been formed. The meteoric occurrence has even suggested the
fanciful notion that all diamonds were originally derived from
meteorites. The meteoric iron of Arizona, some of which contains
diamond, is actually found in and about a huge crater which is
supposed by some to have been formed by an immense meteorite
penetrating the earth&rsquo;s crust.</p>

<p>It is, at any rate, established that carbon can crystallize as diamond
from solution in iron, and other metals; and it seems that high
temperature and pressure and the absence of oxidizing agents are
necessary conditions. The presence of sulphur, nickel, &amp;c., in the
iron appears to favour the production of the diamond. On the other
hand, the occurrence in meteoric stones, and the experiments
mentioned above, show that the diamond may also crystallize from
a basic magma, capable of yielding some of the metallic oxides and
ferro-magnesian silicates; a magma, therefore, which is not devoid
of oxygen. This is still more forcibly suggested by the remarkable
eclogite boulder found in the blue ground of the Newlands mine, not
far from the Vaal river, and described by T. G. Bonney. The boulder
is a crystalline rock consisting of pyroxene (chrome-diopside), garnet,
and a little olivine, and is studded with diamond crystals; a portion
of it is preserved in the British Museum (Natural History). In
another eclogite boulder, diamond was found partly embedded in
pyrope. Similar boulders have also been found in the blue ground
elsewhere. Specimens of pyrope with attached or embedded diamond
had previously been found in the blue ground of the De Beers mines.
In the Newlands boulder the diamonds have the appearance of being
an original constituent of the eclogite. It seems therefore that a holocrystalline
pyroxene-garnet rock may be one source of the diamond
found in blue ground. On the other hand many tons of the somewhat
similar eclogite in the De Beers mine have been crushed and have not
yielded diamond. Further, the ilmenite, which is the most characteristic
associate of the diamond in blue ground, and other of the
accompanying minerals, may have come from basic rocks of a
different nature.</p>

<p>The Inverell occurrence may prove to be another example of
diamond crystallized from a basic rock.</p>

<p>In both occurrences, however, there is still the possibility that the
eclogite or the basalt is not the original matrix, but may have caught
up the already formed diamond from some other matrix. Some
regard the eclogite boulders as derived from deep-seated crystalline
rocks, others as concretions in the blue ground.</p>

<p>None of the inclusions in the diamond gives any clue to its origin;
diamond itself has been found as an inclusion, as have also black
specks of some carbonaceous materials. Other black specks have been
identified as haematite and ilmenite; gold has also been found;
other included minerals recorded are rutile, topaz, quartz, pyrites,
apophyllite, and green scales of chlorite (?). Some of these are of very
doubtful identification; others (<i>e.g.</i> apophyllite and chlorite) may
have been introduced along cracks. Some of the fibrous inclusions
were identified by H. R. Göppert as vegetable structures and were
supposed to point to an organic origin, but this view is no longer held.
Liquid inclusions, some of which are certainly carbon dioxide, have
also been observed.</p>

<p>Finally, then, both experiment and the natural occurrence in rocks
and meteorites suggest that diamond may crystallize not only from
iron but also from a basic silicate magma, possibly from various rocks
consisting of basic silicates. The blue ground of S. Africa may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>163</span>
the result of the serpentinization of several such rocks, and although
now both brecciated and serpentinized some of these may have been
the original matrix. A circumstance often mentioned in support of
this view is the fact that the diamonds in one pipe generally differ
somewhat in character from those of another, even though they be
near neighbours.</p>
</div>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;All the famous diamonds of antiquity must have been
Indian stones. The first author who described the Indian mines
at all fully was the Portuguese, Garcia de Orta (1565), who was
physician to the viceroy of Goa. Before that time there were
only legendary accounts like that of Sindbad&rsquo;s &ldquo;Valley of
the Diamonds,&rdquo; or the tale of the stones found in the brains of
serpents. V. Ball thinks that the former legend originated in the
Indian practice of sacrificing cattle to the evil spirits when a new
mine is opened; birds of prey would naturally carry off the flesh,
and might give rise to the tale of the eagles carrying diamonds
adhering to the meat.</p>

<p>The following are some of the most famous diamonds of the
world:&mdash;</p>

<p>A large stone found in the Golconda mines and said to have
weighed 787 carats in the rough, before being cut by a Venetian
lapidary, was seen in the treasury of Aurangzeb in 1665 by
Tavernier, who estimated its weight after cutting as 280 (?)
carats, and described it as a rounded rose-cut-stone, tall on one
side. The name <i>Great Mogul</i> has been frequently applied to this
stone. Tavernier states that it was the famous stone given to
Shah Jahan by the emir Jumla. The <i>Orloff</i>, stolen by a French
soldier from the eye of an idol in a Brahmin temple, stolen again
from him by a ship&rsquo;s captain, was bought by Prince Orloff for
£90,000, and given to the empress Catharine II. It weighs
194¾ carats, is of a somewhat yellow tinge, and is among the
Russian crown jewels. The <i>Koh-i-nor</i>, which was in 1739 in the
possession of Nadir Shah, the Persian conqueror, and in 1813 in
that of the raja of Lahore, passed into the hands of the East
India Company and was by them presented to Queen Victoria
in 1850. It then weighed 186<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">16</span> carats, but was recut in London
by Amsterdam workmen, and now weighs 106<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">16</span> carats. There
has been much discussion concerning the possibility of this stone
and the Orloff being both fragments of the Great Mogul. The
Mogul Baber in his memoirs (1526) relates how in his conquest of
India he captured at Agra the great stone weighing 8 mishkals,
or 320 ratis, which may be equivalent to about 187 carats. The
Koh-i-nor has been identified by some authors with this stone and
by others with the stone seen by Tavernier. Tavernier, however,
subsequently described and sketched the diamond which he saw
as shaped like a bisected egg, quite different therefore from the
Koh-i-nor. Nevil Story Maskelyne has shown reason for believing
that the stone which Tavernier saw was really the Koh-i-nor
and that it is identical with the great diamond of Baber; and
that the 280 carats of Tavernier is a misinterpretation on his part
of the Indian weights. He suggests that the other and larger
diamond of antiquity which was given to Shah Jahan may
be one which is now in the treasury of Teheran, and that this is
the true Great Mogul which was confused by Tavernier with the
one he saw. (See Ball, Appendix I. to Tavernier&rsquo;s <i>Travels</i> (1889);
and Maskelyne, <i>Nature</i>, 1891, 44, p. 555.).</p>

<p>The <i>Regent</i> or <i>Pitt</i> diamond is a magnificent stone found in
either India or Borneo; it weighed 410 carats and was bought for
£20,400 by Pitt, the governor of Madras; it was subsequently,
in 1717, bought for £80,000 (or, according to some authorities,
£135,000) by the duke of Orleans, regent of France; it was reduced
by cutting to 136<span class="spp">14</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">16</span> carats; was stolen with the other crown
jewels during the Revolution, but was recovered and is still in
France. The <i>Akbar Shah</i> was originally a stone of 116 carats with
Arabic inscriptions engraved upon it; after being cut down to
71 carats it was bought by the gaikwar of Baroda for £35,000.
The <i>Nizam</i>, now in the possession of the nizam of Hyderabad, is
supposed to weigh 277 carats; but it is only a portion of a stone
which is said to have weighed 440 carats before it was broken.
The <i>Great Table</i>, a rectangular stone seen by Tavernier in 1642
at Golconda, was found by him to weigh 242<span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">16</span> carats; Maskelyne
regards it as identical with the <i>Darya-i-nur</i>, which is also a
rectangular stone weighing about 186 carats in the possession of
the shah of Persia. Another stone, the <i>Taj-e-mah</i>, belonging to
the shah, is a pale rose pear-shaped stone and is said to weigh
146 carats.</p>

<p>Other famous Indian diamonds are the following:&mdash;The <i>Sancy</i>,
weighing 53<span class="spp">12</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">16</span> carats, which is said to have been successively the
property of Charles the Bold, de Sancy, Queen Elizabeth,
Henrietta Maria, Cardinal Mazarin, Louis XIV.; to have been
stolen with the Pitt during the French Revolution; and subsequently
to have been the property of the king of Spain, Prince
Demidoff and an Indian prince. The <i>Nassak</i>, 78<span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> carats, the
property of the duke of Westminster. The <i>Empress Eugénie</i>,
51 carats, the property of the gaikwar of Baroda. The <i>Pigott</i>,
49 carats(?), which cannot now be traced. The <i>Pasha</i>, 40 carats.
The <i>White Saxon</i>, 48¾ carats. The <i>Star of Este</i>, 25<span class="spp">13</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">32</span> carats.</p>

<p>Coloured Indian diamonds of large size are rare; the most
famous are:&mdash;a beautiful blue brilliant, 67<span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">16</span> carats, cut from a
stone weighing 112<span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">16</span> carats brought to Europe by Tavernier.
It was stolen from the French crown jewels with the Regent and
was never recovered. The <i>Hope</i>, 44¼ carats, has the same colour
and is probably a portion of the missing stone: it was so-called
as forming part of the collection of H. T. Hope (bought for
£18,000), and was sold again in 1906 (resold 1909). Two other
blue diamonds are known, weighing 13¾ and 1¾ carats, which may
also be portions of the French diamond. The <i>Dresden Green</i>, one
of the Saxon crown jewels, 40 carats, has a fine apple-green
colour. The <i>Florentine</i>, 133<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">5</span> carats, one of the Austrian crown
jewels, is a very pale yellow.</p>

<p>The most famous Brazilian stones are:&mdash;The <i>Star of the South</i>,
found in 1853, when it weighed 254½ carats and was sold for
£40,000; when cut it weighed 125 carats and was bought by the
gaikwar of Baroda for £80,000. Also a diamond belonging to
Mr Dresden, 119 carats before, and 76½ carats after cutting.</p>

<p>Many large stones have been found in South Africa; some are
yellow but some are as colourless as the best Indian or Brazilian
stones. The most famous are the following:&mdash;the <i>Star of South
Africa</i>, or <i>Dudley</i>, mentioned above, 83½ carats rough, 46½ carats
cut. The <i>Stewart</i>, 288<span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> carats rough, 120 carats cut. Both these
were found in the river diggings. The <i>Porter Rhodes</i> from
Kimberley, of the finest water, weighed about 150 carats. The
<i>Victoria</i>, 180 carats, was cut from an octahedron weighing 457½
carats, and was sold to the nizam of Hyderabad for £400,000.
The <i>Tiffany</i>, a magnificent orange-yellow stone, weighs 125½
carats cut. A yellowish octahedron found at De Beers weighed
428½ carats, and yielded a brilliant of 288½ carats. Some of the
finest and largest stones have come from the Jagersfontein mine;
one, the <i>Jubilee</i>, found in 1895, weighed 640 carats in the rough
and 239 carats when cut. Until 1905 the largest known diamond
in the world was the <i>Excelsior</i>, found in 1893 at Jagersfontein by
a native while loading a truck. It weighed 971 carats, and was
ultimately cut into ten stones weighing from 68 to 13 carats.
But all previous records were surpassed in 1905 by a magnificent
stone more than three times the size of any known diamond,
which was found in the yellow ground at the newly discovered
Premier mine in the Transvaal. This extraordinary diamond
weighed 3025¾ carats (1<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> &#8468;) and was clear and water white; the
largest of its surfaces appeared to be a cleavage plane, so that it
might be only a portion of a much larger stone. It was known
as the <i>Cullinan Diamond</i>. This stone was purchased by the
Transvaal government in 1907 and presented to King Edward VII.
It was sent to Amsterdam to be cut, and in 1908 was divided into
nine large stones and a number of small brilliants. The four
largest stones weigh 516½ carats, 309<span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">16</span> carats, 92 carats and 62
carats respectively. Of these the first and second are the largest
brilliants in existence. All the stones are flawless and of the
finest quality.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIAMOND NECKLACE, THE AFFAIR OF THE,<a name="ar3" id="ar3"></a></span> a mysterious
incident at the court of Louis XVI. of France, which involved
the queen Marie Antoinette. The Parisian jewellers Boehmer and
Bassenge had spent some years collecting stones for a necklace
which they hoped to sell to Madame Du Barry, the favourite of
Louis XV., and after his death to Marie Antoinette. In 1778
Louis XVI. proposed to the queen to make her a present of
the necklace, which cost 1,600,000 livres. But the queen is
said to have refused it, saying that the money would be better
spent equipping a man-of-war. According to others, Louis XVI.
himself changed his mind. After having vainly tried to place the
necklace outside of France, the jewellers attempted again in 1781
to sell it to Marie Antoinette after the birth of the dauphin. It
was again refused, but it was evident that the queen regretted
not being able to acquire it.</p>

<p>At that time there was a personage at the court whom Marie
Antoinette particularly detested. It was the cardinal Louis de
Rohan, formerly ambassador at Vienna, whence he had been
recalled in 1774, having incurred the queen&rsquo;s displeasure by
revealing to the empress Maria Theresa the frivolous actions of
her daughter, a disclosure which brought a maternal reprimand,
and for having spoken lightly of Maria Theresa in a letter of
which Marie Antoinette learned the contents. After his return
to France the cardinal was anxious to regain the favour of the
queen in order to obtain the position of prime minister. In March
1784 he entered into relations with a certain Jeanne de St Remy
de Valois, a descendant of a bastard of Henry II., who after many
adventures had married a <i>soi-disant</i> comte de Lamotte, and lived
on a small pension which the king granted her. This adventuress
soon gained the greatest ascendancy over the cardinal, with whom
she had intimate relations. She persuaded him that she had been
received by the queen and enjoyed her favour; and Rohan
resolved to use her to regain the queen&rsquo;s good will. The comtesse
de Lamotte assured the cardinal that she was making efforts on
his behalf, and soon announced to him that he might send his
justification to Marie Antoinette. This was the beginning of a
pretended correspondence between Rohan and the queen, the
adventuress duly returning replies to Rohan&rsquo;s notes, which she
affirmed to come from the queen. The tone of the letters became
very warm, and the cardinal, convinced that Marie Antoinette
was in love with him, became ardently enamoured of her. He
begged the countess to obtain a secret interview for him with the
queen, and a meeting took place in August 1784 in a grove in
the garden at Versailles between him and a lady whom the
cardinal believed to be the queen herself. Rohan offered her
a rose, and she promised him that she would forget the past.
Later a certain Marie Lejay (renamed by the comtesse &ldquo;Baronne
Gay d&rsquo;Oliva,&rdquo; the last word being apparently an anagram of
Valoi), who resembled Marie Antoinette, stated that she had
been engaged to play the role of queen in this comedy. In any
case the countess profited by the cardinal&rsquo;s conviction to borrow
from him sums of money destined ostensibly for the queen&rsquo;s
works of charity. Enriched by these, the countess was able to
take an honourable place in society, and many persons believed
her relations with Marie Antoinette, of which she boasted openly
and unreservedly, to be genuine. It is still an unsettled question
whether she simply mystified people, or whether she was really
employed by the queen for some unknown purpose, perhaps
to ruin the cardinal. In any case the jewellers believed in
the relations of the countess with the queen, and they resolved
to use her to sell their necklace. She at first refused their
commission, then accepted it. On the 21st of January 1785
she announced that the queen would buy the necklace, but
that not wishing to treat directly, she left the affair to a high
personage. A little while later Rohan came to negotiate the
purchase of the famous necklace for the 1,600,000 livres, payable
in instalments. He said that he was authorized by the queen,
and showed the jewellers the conditions of the bargain approved
in the handwriting of Marie Antoinette. The necklace was
given up. Rohan took it to the countess&rsquo;s house, where a man,
in whom Rohan believed he recognized a valet of the queen,
came to fetch it. Madame de Lamotte had told the cardinal
that Marie Antoinette would make him a sign to indicate her
thanks, and Rohan believed that she did make him a sign.
Whether it was so, or merely chance or illusion, no one knows.
But it is certain that the cardinal, convinced that he was acting
for the queen, had engaged the jewellers to thank her; that
Boehmer and Bassenge, before the sale, in order to be doubly sure,
had sent word to the queen of the negotiations in her name; that
Marie Antoinette had allowed the bargain to be concluded, and
that after she had received a letter of thanks from Boehmer, she
had burned it. Meanwhile the &ldquo;comte de Lamotte&rdquo; appears to
have started at once for London, it is said with the necklace,
which he broke up in order to sell the stones.</p>

<p>When the time came to pay, the comtesse de Lamotte presented
the cardinal&rsquo;s notes; but these were insufficient, and
Boehmer complained to the queen, who told him that she had
received no necklace and had never ordered it. She had the
story of the negotiations repeated for her. Then followed a <i>coup
de théâtre</i>. On the 15th of August 1785, Assumption day, when
the whole court was awaiting the king and queen in order to go to
the chapel, the cardinal de Rohan, who was preparing to officiate,
was arrested and taken to the Bastille. He was able, however, to
destroy the correspondence exchanged, as he thought, with the
queen, and it is not known whether there was any connivance of
the officials, who did not prevent this, or not. The comtesse de
Lamotte was not arrested until the 18th of August, after having
destroyed her papers. The police set to work to find all her
accomplices, and arrested the girl Oliva and a certain Reteaux
de Villette, a friend of the countess, who confessed that he had
written the letters given to Rohan in the queen&rsquo;s name, and
had imitated her signature on the conditions of the bargain. The
famous charlatan Cagliostro was also arrested, but it was recognized
that he had taken no part in the affair. The cardinal de
Rohan accepted the parlement of Paris as judges. A sensational
trial resulted (May 31, 1786) in the acquittal of the cardinal, of
the girl Oliva and of Cagliostro. The comtesse de Lamotte was
condemned to be whipped, branded and shut up in the
Salpetrière. Her husband was condemned, in his absence, to the
galleys for life. Villette was banished.</p>

<p>Public opinion was much excited by this trial. It is generally
believed that Marie Antoinette was stainless in the matter, that
Rohan was an innocent dupe, and that the Lamottes deceived
both for their own ends. People, however, persisted in the belief
that the queen had used the countess as an instrument to satisfy
her hatred of the cardinal de Rohan. Various circumstances
fortified this belief, which contributed to render Marie Antoinette
very unpopular&mdash;her disappointment at Rohan&rsquo;s acquittal, the
fact that he was deprived of his charges and exiled to the abbey of
la Chaise-Dieu, and finally the escape of the comtesse de Lamotte
from the Salpetrière, with the connivance, as people believed,
of the court. The adventuress, having taken refuge abroad,
published <i>Mémoires</i> in which she accused the queen. Her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>165</span>
husband also wrote <i>Mémoires</i>, and lived until 1831, after having,
it is said, received subsidies from Louis XVIII.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIANA,<a name="ar4" id="ar4"></a></span> in Roman mythology, an old Italian goddess, in later
times identified with the Greek Artemis (<i>q.v.</i>). That she was
originally an independent Italian deity is shown by her name,
which is the feminine form of Janus (= Dianus). She is essentially
the goddess of the moon and light generally, and presides over
wood, plain and water, the chase and war. As the goddess of
childbirth, she was known, like Juno, by the name of Lucina, the
&ldquo;bringer to light.&rdquo; As the moon-goddess she was also identified
with Hecate, and invoked as &ldquo;three-formed&rdquo; in reference to the
phases of the moon. Her most celebrated shrine was in a grove
at Aricia (whence her title of Nemorensis) near the modern lake of
Nemi. Here she was worshipped side by side with a male deity
Virbius, a god of the forest and the chase. This Virbius was
subsequently identified with Hippolytus, the favourite of Artemis,
who was said to have been brought to life by Aesculapius and
conducted by Diana to Aricia (Ovid, <i>Fasti</i>, iii. 263, vi. 731,
<i>Metam.</i> xv. 497; Virgil, <i>Aeneid</i>, vii. 761). A barbarous custom,
perhaps reminiscent of human sacrifice once offered to her,
prevailed in connexion with her ritual here; her priest, called
<i>Rex Nemorensis</i>, who was a runaway slave, was obliged to qualify
for office by slaying his predecessor in single combat (Strabo v.
p. 239; Suetonius, <i>Caligula</i>, 35). This led to the identification of
Diana with the Tauric Artemis, whose image was said to have been
removed by Orestes to the grove of Aricia (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Aricini</a></span>).</p>

<p>After the destruction of Alba Longa this grove was for a long time
the united sanctuary of the neighbouring Latin and Rutulian cities,
until at last it was extinguished beneath the supremacy of Rome.
The festival of the goddess was on the ides (13th) of August, the
full moon of the hot season. She was worshipped with torches,
her aid was sought by women seeking a happy deliverance in
childbirth, and many votive offerings have been found on the site.
The worship of Diana was brought to Rome by Latin plebeians,
and hence she was regarded as the protectress of the lower
classes, and especially of slaves. In accordance with this, her
most important temple was that on the Aventine, the chief seat
of the plebeians, founded by Servius Tullius, originally as a
sanctuary of the Latin league (Dion. Halic. iv. 26). No man was
allowed to enter the temple, and on the day of its dedication
(August 13) the slaves kept holiday (Plutarch, <i>Quaest. Rom.</i> 100).
This Diana was identified with the sister of Apollo, and at the
secular games she was worshipped simply as Artemis. Another
celebrated sanctuary of Diana was that on the slopes of Mount
Tifata near Capua (where she was worshipped under the name of
Tifatina), a sanctuary specially favoured by Sulla and Vespasian.
As Noctiluca (&ldquo;giving light by night&rdquo;) she had a sanctuary on
the Palatine which was kept illuminated throughout the night
(Varro, <i>L.L.</i> v. 68). On the Nemi priesthood see J. G. Frazer,
<i>Golden Bough</i>.</p>

guenon monkeys taking its name, <i>Cercopithecus diana</i>, from the
presence of a white crescent on the forehead; another characteristic
feature being the pointed white beard. The general colour
of the fur is greyish, with a deep tinge of chestnut from the
middle of the back to the root of the tail. Together with
<i>C. neglectus</i> of East and Central Africa, <i>C. ignitus</i> of Liberia, and

<p><span class="bold">DIANE DE FRANCE<a name="ar6" id="ar6"></a></span> (1538-1619), duchess of Montmorency
and Angoulême, was the natural daughter of Henry II. of France
and a young Piedmontese, Filippe Duc. The constable de
Montmorency went so far as to assert that of all the children of
Henry II. Diane was the only one who resembled him. Catherine
de&rsquo; Medici was greatly incensed at this affront, and took her
revenge by having the constable disgraced on the death of Henry
II. Brantôme is loud in praise of Diane. She was a perfect horsewoman
and dancer, played several musical instruments, knew
Spanish and Italian, and &ldquo;estoit très belle de visage et de taille.&rdquo;
Legitimated in 1547, she was married in 1553 to Horace Farnese,
second son of the duke of Parma, but her husband was killed soon
afterwards at the siege of Hesdin. In order to assure his position,
the constable de Montmorency wished to marry her to his eldest
son, Francis. This was a romantic adventure, for Francis had
clandestinely married Mademoiselle de Piennes. The constable
dissolved this union, and after lengthy negotiations obtained the
dispensation of the pope. On the 3rd of May 1559 Francis
married Diane. A wise and moderate woman, Diane undoubtedly
helped to make Francis de Montmorency one of the leaders of the
party of the <i>politiques</i>. Again a widow in 1579, she had some
influence at the court of Henry III., and negotiated his reconciliation
with Henry of Navarre (1588). She retained her influence
in the reign of Henry IV., conveyed the bodies of Catherine
de&rsquo; Medici and Henry III. to St Denis, and died in 1619 at her
hôtel of Angoulême.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIANE DE POITIERS<a name="ar7" id="ar7"></a></span> (1499-1566), duchess of Valentinois,
and mistress of Henry II. of France, was the daughter of Jean
de Poitiers, seigneur de St Vallier, who came of an old family of
Dauphiné. In 1515 she married Louis de Brézé, grand seneschal
of Normandy, by whom she had two daughters. She became a
widow in 1533, but soon replaced her husband by a more illustrious
lover, the king&rsquo;s second son, Henry, who became dauphin
in 1536. Although he was ten years younger than Diane, she
inspired the young prince with a profound passion, which lasted
until his death. The accession of Henry II. in 1547 was also the
accession of Diane: she was virtual queen, while Henry&rsquo;s lawful
wife, Catherine de&rsquo; Medici, lived in comparative obscurity. The
part Diane played, however, must not be exaggerated. More
rapacious than ambitious, she concerned herself little with
government, but devoted her energies chiefly to augmenting her
income, and providing for her family and friends. Henry was
the most prodigal of lovers, and gave her all rights over the
duchy of Valentinois. Although she showed great tact in her
dealings with the queen, Catherine drove her from the court
after Henry&rsquo;s death, and forced her to restore the crown jewels
and to accept Chaumont in exchange for Chenonceaux. Diane
retired to her château at Anet, where she died in 1566.</p>

<p>Several historians relate that she had been the mistress of
Francis I. before she became the dauphin&rsquo;s mistress, and that she
gave herself to the king in order to obtain the pardon of her
father, who had been condemned to death as an accomplice of the
constable de Bourbon. This rumour, however, has no serious
foundation. Men vied with each other in celebrating Diane&rsquo;s
beauty, which, if we may judge from her portraits, has been
slightly exaggerated. She was a healthy, vigorous woman, and,
by dint of great pains, succeeded in retaining her beauty late into
life. It is said that even on the coldest mornings she would wash
her face with well water. Diane was a patroness of the arts.
She entrusted to Philibert de l&rsquo;Orme the building of her château
at Anet, and it was for her that Jean Goujon executed his masterpiece,
the statue of Diana, now in the Louvre.</p>

for centuries before its existence), the name given to a textile
fabric, formerly of a rich and costly nature with embroidered
ornament, but now of linen or cotton, with a simple woven
pattern; and particularly restricted to small napkins. In
architecture, the term &ldquo;diaper&rdquo; is given to any small pattern of
a conventional nature repeated continuously and uniformly
over a surface; the designs may be purely geometrical, or based
on floral forms, and in early examples were regulated by the process
of their textile origin. Subsequently, similar patterns were
employed in the middle ages for the surface decoration of stone,
as in Westminster Abbey and Bayeux cathedral in the spandrils
of the arcades of the choir and nave; also in mural painting,
stained glass, incised brasses, encaustic tiles, &amp;c. Probably in
most cases the pattern was copied, so far as the general design
is concerned, from the tissues and stuffs of Byzantine manufacture,
which came over to Europe and were highly prized as
ecclesiastical vestments.</p>

<p>In its textile use, the term diaper was originally applied to silk
patterns of a geometrical pattern; it is now almost exclusively used
for diamond patterns made from linen or cotton yarns. An illustration
of two patterns of this nature is shown in the figure. The floats
of the warp and the weft are mostly in three; indeed the patterns
are made from a base weave which is composed entirely of
floats of this number. It will be seen that both designs are formed
of what may be termed concentric figures&mdash;alternately black and
white. Pattern B differs from pattern A only in that more of these
concentric figures are used for the complete figure. If pattern B,
which shows only one unit, were extended, the effect would be similar
to A, except for the size of the unit. In A there are four complete
units, and hence the pattern appears more striking. Again, the
repeating of B would cause the four corner pieces to join and to form
a diamond similar to the one in the centre. The two diamonds in B
would then alternate diagonally to left and right. Special names are
given to certain kinds of diapers, <i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;bird&rsquo;s-eye,&rdquo; &ldquo;pheasant&rsquo;s-eye&rdquo;;
these terms indicate, to a certain extent, the size of the
complete diamond in the cloth&mdash;the smaller kind taking the name
&ldquo;bird&rsquo;s-eye.&rdquo; The size of the pattern on paper has little connexion
with the size of the pattern in the cloth, for it is clearly the number
of threads and picks per inch which determine the size of the pattern
in the cloth from any given design. Although A is larger than what
is usually termed the &ldquo;bird&rsquo;s-eye&rdquo; pattern, it is evident that it may
be made to appear as such, provided that the cloth is fine enough.
These designs, although adapted mostly for cloths such as nursery-diapers,
for pinafores, &amp;c., are sometimes used in the production of
towels and table-cloths. In the figure, the first pick in A is identical
with the first pick in B, and the part C shows how each interweaves
with the twenty-four threads.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIAPHORETICS<a name="ar10" id="ar10"></a></span> (from Gr. <span class="grk" title="diaphorein">&#948;&#953;&#945;&#966;&#959;&#961;&#949;&#8150;&#957;</span>, to carry through),
the name given to those remedies which promote perspiration.
In health there is constantly taking place an exhalation of
watery vapour from the skin, by which not only are many of the
effete products of nutrition eliminated, but the body is kept cool.
Under exertion or in a heated atmosphere this natural function
of the skin is increased, sweating more or less profuse follows,
and, evaporation going on rapidly over the whole surface, little
or no rise in the temperature of the body takes place. In many
forms of disease, such as fevers and inflammatory affections, the
action of the skin is arrested, and the surface of the body feels
harsh and dry, while the temperature is greatly elevated. The
occurrence of perspiration not unfrequently marks a crisis in such
diseases, and is in general regarded as a favourable event. In
some chronic diseases, such as diabetes and some cases of
Bright&rsquo;s disease, the absence of perspiration is a marked feature;
while, on the other hand, in many wasting diseases, such as
phthisis, the action of the skin is increased, and copious exhausting
sweating occurs. Many means can be used to induce perspiration,
among the best known being baths, either in the form of hot
vapour or hot water baths, or in that part of the process of
the Turkish bath which consists in exposing the body to a dry and
hot atmosphere. Such measures, particularly if followed by the
drinking of hot liquids and the wrapping of the body in warm
clothing, seldom fail to excite copious perspiration. Numerous
medicinal substances have the same effect.</p>

or midriff (Anglo-Saxon, <i>mid</i>, middle, <i>hrif</i>, belly) in
human anatomy is a large fibro-muscular partition between the
cavities of the thorax and abdomen; it is convex toward the
thorax, concave toward the abdomen, and consists of a central
tendon and a muscular margin. The <i>central tendon</i> (q, fig. 1) is trefoil
in shape, its leaflets being right, left and anterior; of these the right
is the largest and the left the smallest. The fleshy fibres rise, in
front from the back of the xiphoid cartilage of the sternum (d),
laterally by six serrations, from the inner surfaces of the lower six
ribs, interdigitating with the transversalis, posteriorly from the
arcuate ligaments, of which there are five, a pair of external, a
pair of internal, and a single median one. The <i>external arcuate
ligament</i> (h) stretches from the tip of the twelfth rib (b) to the
costal process of the first lumbar vertebra in front of the quadratus
lumborum muscle (o), the <i>internal</i> and <i>middle</i> are continuations
of the <i>crura</i> which rise from the ventro-lateral aspects of
the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae, the right (e) coming from
three, the left (f) from two. On reaching the level of the twelfth
thoracic vertebra each crus spreads out into a fan-shaped mass of
fibres, of which the innermost join their fellows from the opposite
crus, in front of the aortic opening (k), to form the <i>middle arcuate
ligament</i>; the outer ones (g) arch in front of the psoas muscle (n)
to the tip of the costal process of the first lumbar vertebra to
form the <i>internal arcuate ligament</i>, while the intermediate ones
pass to the central tendon. There are three large openings in the
diaphragm; the <i>aortic</i> (k) is behind the middle arcuate ligament
and transmits the aorta, the vena azygos major, and the thoracic
duct. In the right leaflet is an opening (sometimes called the
<i>hiatus quadratus</i>) for the inferior vena cava and a branch of the
right phrenic nerve (m), while in front and a little to the left of
the aortic opening is one for the oesophagus and the two pneumogastric
nerves (l), the left being in front and the right behind.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>167</span>
The fleshy fibres on each side of this opening act as a sphincter.
Passing between the xiphoid and costal origins in front are the
superior epigastric arteries, while the other terminal branches of
the internal mammaries, the musculo-phrenics, pass through

<p>Through the crura pass the splanchnic nerves, and in addition
to these the left crus is pierced by the vena azygos minor. The
sympathetic nerves usually enter the abdomen behind the internal
arcuate ligaments. The phrenic nerves, which are the main
supply of the diaphragm, divide before reaching the muscle and
pierce it in a number of places to enter its abdominal surface, but
some of the lower intercostal nerves assist in the supply. The last
thoracic or subcostal nerves pass behind the external arcuate
ligament.</p>

<p>For the action of the diaphragm see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Respiratory System</a></span>.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Embryology.</i>&mdash;The diaphragm is at first developed in the neck region
of the embryo, and this accounts for the phrenic nerves, which supply
it, rising from the fourth and fifth cervical. From the mesoderm on
the caudal side of the pericardium is developed the <i>septum transversum</i>,
and in this the central tendon is formed. The fleshy portion is
developed on each side in two parts, an anterior or sterno-costal
which is derived from the longitudinal neck musculature, probably
the same layer from which the sternothyroid comes, and a spinal part
which is a derivative of the transversalis sheet of the trunk. Between
these two parts is at one time a gap, the <i>spino-costal hiatus</i>, and this
is obliterated by the growth of the pleuro-peritoneal membrane, which
may occasionally fail to close and so may form the site of a phrenic
hernia. With the growth of the body and the development of the
lungs the diaphragm shifts its position until it becomes the septum
between the thoracic and abdominal cavities. (See A. Keith, &ldquo;On the
Development of the Diaphragm,&rdquo; <i>Jour. of Anat. and Phys.</i> vol. 39.)
A. Paterson has recorded cases in which the left half of the diaphragm
is wanting (<i>Proceedings</i> of the Anatomical Society of Gt. Britain,
June 1900; <i>Jour. of Anat. and Phys.</i> vol. 34), and occasionally
deficiencies are found elsewhere, especially in the sternal portion.
For further details see Quain&rsquo;s <i>Anatomy</i>, vol. i. (London, 1908).</p>

<p><i>Comparative Anatomy.</i>&mdash;A complete diaphragm, separating the
thoracic from the abdominal parts of the coelom, is characteristic of
the Mammalia; it usually has the human structure and relations
except that below the Anthropoids it is separated from the pericardium
by the azygous lobe of the lung. In some Mammals, <i>e.g.</i> Echidna
and Phocoena, it is entirely muscular. In the Cetacea it is remarkable
for its obliquity; its vertebral attachment is much nearer the tail
than its sternal or ventral one; this allows a much larger lung space
in the dorsal than in the ventral part of the thorax, and may be
concerned with the equipoise of the animal. (Otto Müller, &ldquo;Untersuchungen
über die Veränderung, welche die Respirationsorgane der
Säugetiere durch die Anpassung an das Leben im Wasser erlitten
haben,&rdquo; <i>Jen. Zeitschr. f. Naturwiss.</i>, 1898, p. 93.) In the Ungulata
only one crus is found (Windle and Parsons, &ldquo;Muscles of the
Ungulata,&rdquo; <i>Proc. Zool. Soc.</i>, 1903, p. 287). Below the Mammals
incomplete partitions between the pleural and peritoneal cavities
are found in Chelonians, Crocodiles and Birds, and also in Amphibians
(Xenopus and Pipa).</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIARBEKR<a name="fa1b" id="fa1b" href="#ft1b"><span class="sp">1</span></a><a name="ar12" id="ar12"></a></span> (<i>Kara Amid</i> or Black Amid; the Roman
<i>Amida</i>), the chief town of a vilayet of Asiatic Turkey, situated
on a basaltic plateau on the right bank of the Tigris, which here
flows in a deep open valley. The town is still surrounded by the
masonry walls of black basalt which give it the name of <i>Kara</i>
or Black Amid; they are well built and imposing on the west
facing the open country, but almost in ruins where they overlook
the river. A mass of gardens and orchards cover the slope down
to the river on the S.W., but there are no suburbs outside the
walls. The houses are rather crowded but only partially fill
the walled area. The population numbers 38,000, nearly half
being Christian, comprising Turks, Kurds, Arabs, Turkomans,
Armenians, Chaldeans, Jacobites and a few Greeks. The streets
are 10 ft. to 15 ft. wide, badly paved and dirty; the houses and
shops are low, mostly of stone, and some of stone and mud.
The bazaar is a good one, and gold and silver filigree work is
made, peculiar in character and design. The cotton industry is
declining, but manufacture of silk is increasing. Fruit is good and
abundant as the rich volcanic soil is well watered from the town
springs. The size of the melons is specially famous. To the
south, the walls are some 40 ft. high, faced with large cut stone
blocks of very solid construction, with towers and square bastions
rising to 500 ft. There are four gates: on the north the Kharput
gate, on the west the Rum, on the south the Mardin, and on the
east the Yeni Kapu or new gate. A citadel enclosure stands
at the N. E. corner and is now partly in ruins, but the interior
space is occupied by the government konak. The summer
climate in the confined space within the town is excessively hot
and unhealthy. Epidemics of typhus are not unknown, as well
as ophthalmia. The Diarbekr boil is like the &ldquo;Aleppo button,&rdquo;
lasting a long time and leaving a deep scar. Winters are frequently
severe but do not last long. Snow sometimes lies, and
ice is stored for summer use. Scorpions noted for the virulence of
their poison abound as well as horse leeches in the tanks. The
town is supplied with water both by springs inside the town
and by aqueducts from fountains at Ali Punar and Hamervat.
The principal exports are wool, mohair and copper ore, and
imports are cotton and woollen goods, indigo, coffee, sugar,
petroleum, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The Great Mosque, Ulu Jami, formerly a Christian church,
occupies the site of a Sassanian palace and was built with
materials from an older palace, probably that of Tigranes II.
The remains consist of the façades of two palaces 400 ft. apart,
each formed by a row of Corinthian columns surmounted by an
equal number of a Byzantine type. Kufic inscriptions run across
the fronts under the entablature. The court of the mosque
is entered by a gateway on which lions and other animals are
sculptured. The churches of greatest interest are those of SS.
Cosmas and Damian (Jacobite) and the church of St James
(Greek). In the 19th century Diarbekr was one of the largest
and most flourishing cities of Asia, and as a commercial centre it
now stands at the meeting-point of several important routes. It
is at the head of the navigation of the Tigris, which is traversed
down stream by <i>keleks</i> or rafts supported by inflated skins.
There is a good road to Aleppo and Alexandretta on the Mediterranean,
and to Samsun on the Black Sea by Kharput, Malatia
and Sivas. There are also routes to Mosul and Bitlis.</p>

<p>Diarbekr became a Roman colony in <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 230 under the name
of Amida, and received a Christian bishop in <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 325. It was
enlarged and strengthened by Constantius II., in whose reign it
was taken after a long siege by Shapur (Sapor) II., king of Persia.
The historian Ammianus Marcellinus, who took part in the
defence, gives a detailed account of it. In the later wars between
the Persians and Romans it more than once changed hands.
Though ceded by Jovian to the Persians it again became annexed
to the Roman empire, and in the reign of Anastasius (<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 502)
was once more taken by the Persians, when 80,000 of its inhabitants
were slain. It was taken c. 638 by the Arabs, and
afterwards passed into the hands of the Seljuks and Persians,
from whom it was finally captured by Selim I. in 1515; and
since that date it has remained under Ottoman rule. About 2 m.
below the town is a masonry bridge over the Tigris; the older
portion being probably Roman, and the western part, which bears
a Kufic inscription, being Arab.</p>

<p>The vilayet of Diarbekr extends south from Palu on the
Euphrates to Mardin and Nisibin on the edge of the Mesopotamian
plain, and is divided into three sanjaks&mdash;Arghana, Diarbekr and
Mardin. The headwaters of the main arm of the Tigris have
their source in the vilayet.</p>

<p>Cereals, cotton, tobacco, rice and silk are produced, but most of
the fertile lands have been abandoned to semi-nomads, who raise
large quantities of live stock. The richest portion of the vilayet
lies east of the capital in the rolling plains watered by tributaries
of the Tigris. An exceptionally rich copper mine exists at
Arghana Maden, but it is very imperfectly worked; galena
mineral oil and silicious sand are also found.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DIARY,<a name="ar14" id="ar14"></a></span> the Lat. <i>diarium</i> (from <i>dies</i>, a day), the book in which
are preserved the daily memoranda regarding events and actions
which come under the writer&rsquo;s personal observation, or are
related to him by others. The person who keeps this record is
called a diarist. It is not necessary that the entries in a diary
should be made each day, since every life, however full, must
contain absolutely empty intervals. But it is essential that the
entry should be made during the course of the day to which it
refers. When this has evidently not been done, as in the case of
Evelyn&rsquo;s diary, there is nevertheless an effort made to give the
memoranda the effect of being so recorded, and in point of fact,
even in a case like that of Evelyn, it is probable that what we
now read is an enlargement of brief notes jotted down on the day
cited. When this is not approximately the case, the diary is a
fraud, for its whole value depends on its instantaneous transcript
of impressions.</p>

<p>In its primitive form, the diary must always have existed; as
soon as writing was invented, men and women must have wished
to note down, in some almanac or journal, memoranda respecting
their business, their engagements or their adventures. But
the literary value of these would be extremely insignificant until
the spirit of individualism had crept in, and human beings began
to be interesting to other human beings for their own sake. It
is not, therefore, until the close of the Renaissance that we find
diaries beginning to have literary value, although, as the study of
sociology extends, every scrap of genuine and unaffected record
of early history possesses an ethical interest. In the 17th century,
diaries began to be <span class="correction" title="amended from largly">largely</span> written in England, although in most
cases without any idea of even eventual publication. Sir William
Dugdale (1605-1686) had certainly no expectation that his slight
diary would ever see the light. There is no surviving record of
a journal kept by Clarendon, Richard Baxter, Lucy Hutchinson
and other autobiographical writers of the middle of the century,
but we may take it for granted that they possessed some such
record, kept from day to day. Bulstrode Whitelocke (1605-1675),
whose <i>Memorials of the English Affairs</i> covers the ground
from 1625 to 1660, was a genuine diarist. So was the elder George
Fox (1624-1690), who kept not merely &ldquo;a great journal,&rdquo; but
&ldquo;the little journal books,&rdquo; and whose work was published in
1694. The famous diary of John Evelyn (1620-1706) professes
to be the record of seventy years, and, although large tracts of it
are covered in a very perfunctory manner, while in others many of
the entries have the air of having been written in long after the
event, this is a very interesting and amusing work; it was not
published until 1818. In spite of all its imperfections there is a
great charm about the diary of Evelyn, and it would hold a still
higher position in the history of literature than it does if it were
not overshadowed by what is unquestionably the most illustrious
of the diaries of the world, that of Samuel Pepys (1633-1703).
This was begun on the 1st of January 1660 and was carried on
until the 29th of May 1669. The extraordinary value of Pepys&rsquo;
diary consists in its fidelity to the portraiture of its author&rsquo;s
character. He feigns nothing, conceals nothing, sets nothing
down in malice or insincerity. He wrote in a form of shorthand
intelligible to no one but himself, and not a phrase betrays the
smallest expectation that any eye but his own would ever
investigate the pages of his confession. The importance of this
wonderful document, in fact, lay unsuspected until 1819, when
the Rev. John Smith of Baldock began to decipher the MS. in
Magdalene College, Cambridge. It was not until 1825 that Lord
Braybrooke published part of what was only fully edited, under
the care of Mr Wheatley, in 1893-1896. In the age which succeeded
that of Pepys, a diary of extraordinary emotional interest
was kept by Swift from 1710 to 1713, and was sent to Ireland in
the form of a &ldquo;Journal to Stella&rdquo;; it is a surprising amalgam
of ambition, affection, wit and freakishness. John Byrom
(1692-1763), the Manchester poet, kept a journal, which was
published in 1854. The diary of the celebrated dissenting divine,
Philip Doddridge (1702-1751), was printed in 1829. Of far
greater interest are the admirably composed and vigorously
written journals of John Wesley (1703-1791). But the most
celebrated work of this kind produced in the latter half of the 18th
century was the diary of Fanny Burney (Madame D&rsquo;Arblay),
published in 1842-1846. It will be perceived that, without
exception, these works were posthumously published, and the
whole conception of the diary has been that it should be written
for the writer alone, or, if for the public, for the public when all
prejudice shall have passed away and all passion cooled down.
Thus, and thus only, can the diary be written so as to impress
upon its eventual readers a sense of its author&rsquo;s perfect sincerity
and courage.</p>

<p>Many of the diaries described above were first published in the
opening years of the 19th century, and it is unquestionable that
the interest which they awakened in the public led to their
imitation. Diaries ceased to be rare, but as a rule the specimens
which have hitherto appeared have not presented much literary
interest. Exception must be made in favour of the journals of
two minor politicians, Charles Greville (1794-1865) and Thomas
Creevey (1768-1838), whose indiscretions have added much to the
gaiety of nations; the papers of the former appeared in 1874-1887,
those of the latter in 1903. The diary of Henry Crabb
Robinson (1775-1867), printed in 1869, contains excellent
biographical material. Tom Moore&rsquo;s journal, published in 1856
by Lord John Russell, disappointed its readers. But it is
probable, if we reason by the analogy of the past, that the most
curious and original diaries of the 19th century are still unknown
to us, and lie jealously guarded under lock and key by the
descendants of those who compiled them.</p>

<p>It was natural that the form of the diary should appeal to a
people so sensitive to social peculiarities and so keen in the
observation of them as the French. A medieval document of
immense value is the diary kept by an anonymous <i>curé</i> during
the reigns of Charles VI. and Charles VII. This <i>Journal d&rsquo;un
bourgeois de Paris</i> was kept from 1409 to 1431, and was continued
by another hand down to 1449. The marquis de Dangeau
(1638-1720) kept a diary from 1684 till the year of his death;
this although dull, and as Saint-Simon said &ldquo;of an insipidity to
make you sick,&rdquo; is an inexhaustible storehouse of facts about
the reign of Louis XIV. Saint-Simon&rsquo;s own brilliant memoirs,
written from 1691 to 1723, may be considered as a sort of diary.
The lawyer, Edmond Barbier (1689-1771), wrote a journal of the
anecdotes and little facts which came to his knowledge from
1718 to 1762. The studious care which he took to be correct, and
his manifest candour, give a singular value to Barbier&rsquo;s record;
his diary was not printed at all until 1847, nor, in its entirety,
until 1857. The song-writer, Charles Collé (1709-1783), kept a
<i>journal historique</i> from 1758 to 1782; it is full of vivacity, but very
scandalous and spiteful. It saw the light in 1805, and surprised
those to whom Collé, in his lifetime, had seemed the most placid
and good-natured of men. Petit de Bachaumont (1690-1770)
had access to remarkable sources of information, and his
<i>Mémoires secrets</i> (a diary the publication of which began in
1762 and was continued after Bachaumont&rsquo;s death, until 1787,
by other persons) contains a valuable mass of documents. The
marquis d&rsquo;Argenson (1694-1757) kept a diary, of which a comparatively
full text was first published in 1859. In recent times the
posthumous publication of the diaries of the Russian artist, Marie
Bashkirtseff (1860-1884), produced a great sensation in 1887, and
revealed a most remarkable temperament. The brothers Jules
and Edmond de Goncourt kept a very minute diary of all that
occurred around them in artistic and literary Paris; after
the death of Jules, in 1870, this was continued by Edmond, who
published the three first volumes in 1888. The publication of this
work was continued, and it produced no little scandal. It is
excessively ill-natured in parts, but of its vivid picturesqueness,
and of its general accuracy as a transcript of conversation, there
can be no two opinions.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIASPORE,<a name="ar15" id="ar15"></a></span> a native aluminium hydroxide, AlO(OH), crystallizing
in the orthorhombic system and isomorphous with göthite
and manganite. It occurs sometimes as flattened crystals, but
usually as lamellar or scaly masses, the flattened surface being a
direction of perfect cleavage on which the lustre is markedly
pearly in character. It is colourless or greyish-white, yellowish,
sometimes violet in colour, and varies from translucent to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>169</span>
transparent. It may be readily distinguished from other colourless
transparent minerals, with a perfect cleavage and pearly
lustre&mdash;mica, talc, brucite, gypsum&mdash;by its greater hardness
of 6½-7. The specific gravity is 3.4. When heated before the
blowpipe it decrepitates violently, breaking up into white pearly
scales; it was because of this property that the mineral was
named diaspore by R. J. Hauy in 1801, from <span class="grk" title="diaspeirein">&#948;&#953;&#945;&#963;&#960;&#949;&#943;&#961;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>, &ldquo;to

corundum or emery, and is found in granular limestone and
other crystalline rocks. Well-developed crystals are found in the
emery deposits of the Urals and at Chester, Massachusetts, and
in kaolin at Schemnitz in Hungary. If obtainable in large
quantity it would be of economic importance as a source of
alumina.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIATOMACEAE.<a name="ar17" id="ar17"></a></span> For the knowledge we possess of these
beautiful plants, so minute as to be undiscernible by our unaided
vision, we are indebted to the assistance of the microscope. It
was not till towards the close of the 18th century that the first
known forms of this group were discovered by O. F. Muller. And
so slow was the process of discovery in this field of scientific research
that in the course of half a century, when Agardh published
his <i>Systema algarum</i> in 1824, only forty-nine species included
under eight genera had been described. Since that time, however,
with modern microscopes and microscopic methods, eminent
botanists in all parts of the civilized world have studied these
minute plants, with the result that the number of known genera
and species has been greatly increased. Over 10,000 species of
diatoms have been described, and about 1200 species and
numerous varieties occur in the fresh waters and on the coasts
of Great Britain and Ireland. Rabenhorst, in the index to his
<i>Flora Europaea algarum</i> (1864) enumerated about 4000 forms
which had up to that time been discovered throughout the
continent of Europe.</p>

<p>The diatoms are more commonly known among systematic
botanists as the Bacillarieae, particularly on the continent of
Europe, and although such an immense number of very diverse
forms are included in it, the group as a whole exhibits a remarkable
uniformity of structure. The Bacillarieae is one of the
large groups of Algae, placed by some in close proximity to the
Conjugatae and by others as an order of the Brown Algae (or
Phaeophyceae), but their characters are so distinctive and their
structure is so uniform as to warrant the separation of the diatoms
as a distinct class. The affinities of the group are doubtful.</p>

<p>The diatoms exhibit great
variety of form. While some
species are circular and more
or less disk-shaped, others are oval in outline. Some are
linear, as <i>Synedra Ulna</i> (fig. 2), others more or less crescentic;
others again are cuneate, as <i>Podosphenia Lyngbyii</i>
(fig. 3); some few have a sigmoid outline, as <i>Pleurosigma
balticum</i> (fig. 4); but the prevailing
forms are naviculoid, as in the large family
Naviculaceae, of which the genus <i>Navicula</i>
embraces upwards of 1000 species. They vary
also in their modes of growth,&mdash;some being
free-floating, others attached to foreign bodies
by simple or branched gelatinous stalks, which
in some species are short and thick, while in
others they are long and slender. In some
genera the forms are simple, while in others the
frustules are connected together in ribbon-like
filaments, or form, as in other cases, zigzag
chains. In some genera the individuals are
naked, while in many others they are enclosed in a more or less
definite gelatinous investment. The conditions necessary to
their growth are
moisture and
light. Wherever
these circumstances
coexist,
diatomaceous
forms will almost invariably be found. They occur mixed
with other organisms on the surface of moist rocks; in
streamlets and pools, they form a brownish stratum on
the surface of the mud, or cover the stems and leaves of
water plants or floating twigs with a furry investment.
Marine forms are usually attached to various sea-weeds, and
many are found in the stomachs of molluscs, holothurians,
ascidians and other denizens of the ocean. The fresh-water
forms are specifically distinct from those incidental to salt or
brackish water,&mdash;fresh-water species, however, are sometimes
carried some distance into the sea by the force of the current, and
in tidal rivers marine forms are carried up by the force of the tide.
Some notion may be formed of the extreme minuteness of these
forms from the fact that one the length of which is <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">200</span>th of an
inch may be considered as beyond the medium size. Some few,
indeed, are much larger, but by far the greater proportion are of
very much smaller dimensions.</p>

<p>Diatoms are unicellular plants distinguished from kindred
forms by the fact of having their soft vegetative part covered by
a siliceous case. Each individual is known as a frustule, and the
cell-wall consists of two similar valves nearly parallel to each
other, each valve being furnished with a rim (or connecting-band)
projecting from it at a right angle.</p>

<p>One of these valves with its rim is slightly smaller than the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>170</span>
other, the smaller fitting into the larger pretty much as a pill-box
fits into its cover. This peculiarity of structure affords ample
scope for the growth of the protoplasmic cell-contents, for as the
latter increase in volume the siliceous valves are pushed out, and
their corresponding siliceous rims become broader. The connecting-bands
although closely fitting their respective valves are
distinct from them, and together the two bands form the girdle.</p>

<p>An individual diatom is usually described from two aspects,
one in which the surface of the valve is exposed to view&mdash;the
valve view, and one in which the girdle side is exposed&mdash;the
girdle view. The valves are thin and transparent, convex on the
outside, and generally ornamented with a variety of sculptured
markings. These sculptures often present the aspect of striae
across the face of the valve, and the best lenses have shown them
to consist of a series of small cavities within the siliceous wall of
the cell. The valves of some of the marine genera exhibit a
beautiful areolated structure due to the presence of larger
chambers within the siliceous cell-wall. Many diatoms possess
thickenings of the cell-wall, visible in the valve view, in the
centre of the valve and at each extremity. These thickenings
are known as the nodules, and they are generally connected by a
long median line, the raphe, which is a cleft in the siliceous valve,
extending at least some part of its length.</p>

<p>The protoplasmic contents of this siliceous box-like unicell are
very similar to the contents of many other algal cells. There is a
living protoplasmic layer or primordial utricle, connected either
by two broad bands or by a number of anastomosing threads with
a central mass of protoplasm in which the nucleus is embedded.
The greater part of the cavity of the cell is occupied by one
or several fluid vacuoles. The characteristic brown colour of
diatoms is due to the presence of chromatophores embedded in
the lining layer of protoplasm. In number and form these
chromatophores are variable. They contain chlorophyll, but the
green colour is masked by the presence of diatomin, a brown
pigment which resembles that which occurs in the Brown Algae
or Phaeophyceae. The chromatophores contain a variable
number of pyrenoids, colourless proteid bodies of a crystalloidal
character.</p>

<p>One of the first phenomena which comes under the notice of
the observer is the extraordinary power of motion with which
the frustules are endowed. Some species move slowly backwards
and forwards in pretty much the same line, but in the case of
<i>Bacillaria paradoxa</i> the motion is very rapid, the frustules darting
through the water in a zigzag course. To account for this motion
various theories have been suggested, none of which appear to be
altogether satisfactory. There is little doubt that the movements
are connected with the raphe, and in some diatoms there is much
evidence to prove that they are due to an exudation of mucilage.</p>

<p><i>Classification.</i>&mdash;The most natural system of classification of the
Bacillarieae is the one put forward by Schütt (1896), and since
generally followed by systematists. He separates them into two
primary divisions, the &lsquo;Centricae&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Pennatae.&rsquo; The
former includes all those diatoms which in the valve view possess
a radial symmetry around a central point, and which are destitute
of a raphe (or a pseudoraphe). The latter includes those which
are zygomorphic or otherwise irregular, and in which the valve
view is generally boat-shaped or needle-shaped, with the markings
arranged in a sagittal manner on each side of a raphe or
pseudoraphe.</p>

<p><i>Reproduction.</i>&mdash;In the Diatomaceae, as well as in the Desmidieae,
the ordinary mode of increase is by simple cell-division. The
cell-contents within the enclosure of the siliceous case separate
into two distinct masses. As these two daughter-masses become
more and more developed, the valves of the mother-cell are pushed
more and more widely apart. A new siliceous valve is secreted by
each of the two masses on the side opposite to the original valve,
the new valves being situated within the girdle of the original
frustule. When this process has been completed the girdle of
the mother frustule gives way, and two distinct frustules are
formed, the siliceous valves in each of these new frustules being
one of the valves of the mother-cell, and a newly formed valve
similar and more or less parallel to it.</p>

<p>During the life of the plant this process of self-division is
continued with an almost incredible rapidity. On this subject
the observation of Professor William Smith, writing in 1853, is
worthy of special notice:&mdash;&ldquo;I have been unable to ascertain the
time occupied in a single act of self-division, but supposing it to be
completed in twenty-four hours we should have, as the progeny of
a single frustule, the amazing number of 1,000,000,000 in a single
month, a circumstance which will in some degree explain the
sudden, or at least rapid, appearance of these organisms in
localities where they were a
short time previously either
unrecognized or sparingly diffused&rdquo;
(<i>British Diatomaceae</i>,
vol. i. p. 25).</p>

<p>Individual diatoms when
once produced by cell-division
are incapable of any increase
in size owing to the rigidity of
their siliceous cell-walls, and
since the new valves are always
formed <i>within</i> the girdle of the
old ones, it would follow that
every succeeding generation is
reduced in size by the thickness
of the girdle. In some diatoms,
however, this is not strictly
true as daughter-cells are sometimes
produced of larger size
than the parent-cells. Thus,
the reduction in size of the
individuals is not always
proportionate to the number
of cell-divisions.</p>

<p>On the diminution in size
having reached a limit in any
species, the maximum size is
regained by the formation of
an auxospore. There are five
known methods of reproduction by auxospores, but it is unnecessary
here to enter into details of these methods. Suffice it to
say that a normal auxospore is produced by the conjugation
of two parent-cells, its distinguishing feature being a rejuvenescence
accompanied by a marked increase in size. These
auxospores formed without conjugation are parthenogenetic.</p>

<p><i>Mode of Preparation.</i>&mdash;The Diatomaceae are usually gathered
in small bottles, and special care should be taken to collect them
as free as possible from extraneous matter. A small portion having
been examined under the microscope, should the gathering be
thought worthy of preservation, some of the material is boiled in
acid for the purpose of cleaning it. The acids usually employed
are hydrochloric, nitric or sulphuric, according as circumstances
require. When the operator considers that by this process all
foreign matter has been eliminated, the residuum is put into a
precipitating jar of a conical shape, broader at the bottom than
at the top, and covered to the brim with filtered or distilled water.
When the diatoms have settled in the bottom of the jar, the
supernatant fluid is carefully removed by a syringe or some
similar instrument, so that the sediment be not disturbed. The
jar is again filled with water, and the process repeated till the acid
has been completely removed. It is desirable afterwards to boil
the sediment for a short time with supercarbonate of soda, the
alkali being removed in the same manner as the acid. A small
portion may then be placed with a pipette upon a slip of glass,
and, when the moisture has been thoroughly evaporated, the film
that remains should be covered with dilute Canada balsam, and,
a thin glass cover having been gently laid over the balsam, the
preparation should be laid aside for a short time to harden, and
then is ready for observation.</p>

<p><i>General Remarks.</i>&mdash;Diatoms are most abundant in cold
latitudes, having a general preference for cold water. In the
pelagic waters of lakes and of the oceans they are often very
abundant, and in the cold waters of the Arctic and Antarctic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>171</span>
Oceans they exist in prodigious numbers. They thus form a large
proportion of both the marine and the fresh-water plankton.</p>

<p>Large numbers of fossil diatoms are known. Not only are
these minute plants assisting at the present time in the accumulation
of oceanic and lake deposits, but in former ages they have
been sufficiently active to give rise to considerable deposits of
diatomaceous earths. When the plant has fulfilled its natural
course the siliceous covering sinks to the bottom of the water in
which it had lived, and there forms part of the sediment. When
in the process of ages, as it has often happened, the accumulated
sediment has been hardened into solid rock, the siliceous frustules
of the diatoms remain unaltered, and, if the rock be disintegrated
by natural or artificial means, may be removed from the
enveloping matrix and subjected to examination under the
microscope. The forms found may from their character help in
some degree to illustrate the conditions under which the stratum
of rock had been originally deposited. These earths are generally
of a white or grey colour. Some of them are hard, but most
are soft and friable. Many of them are of economic importance,
being used as polishing powders (&ldquo;Tripoli&rdquo;), as absorbents for
nitroglycerin in the manufacture of dynamite (&ldquo;Kieselguhr&rdquo;),
as a dentifrice, and more recently they have been used to a large
extent in the manufacture of non-conducting and sound-proof
materials. Most of these diatomaceous earths are associated
with rocks of Tertiary formations, although it is generally
regarded that the earliest appearance of diatoms is in the Upper
Cretaceous (chalk).</p>

<p>Vast deposits of Diatomaceous earths have been discovered in
various parts of the world,&mdash;some the deposit of fresh, others of
salt water. Of these deposits the most remarkable for extent,
as well as for the number and beauty of the species contained in it,
is that of Richmond, in Virginia, one of the United States of
America. It extends for many miles, and is in some places at
least 40 ft. deep. It is a remarkable fact that though the generations
of a diatom in the space of a few months far exceed in
number the generation of man during the period usually assigned
to the existence of the race, the fossil genera and species are
in most respects to the most minute details identical with the
numerous living representatives of their class.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIAVOLO, FRA<a name="ar19" id="ar19"></a></span> (1771-1806), the popular name given to a
famous Italian brigand associated with the political revolutions
of southern Italy at the time of the French invasion. His real
name was Michele Pezza, and he was born of low parentage
at Itri; he had committed many murders and robberies in the
Terra di Lavoro, but by good luck combined with audacity he
always escaped capture, whence his name of Fra Diavolo, popular
superstition having invested him with the characters of a monk
and a demon, and it seems that at one time he actually was a
monk. When the kingdom of Naples was overrun by the French
and the Parthenopaean Republic established (1799), Cardinal
Ruffo, acting on behalf of the Bourbon king Ferdinand IV., who
had fled to Sicily, undertook the reconquest of the country, and
for this purpose he raised bands of peasants, gaol-birds, brigands,
&amp;c., under the name of Sanfedisti or <i>bande della Santa Fede</i>
(&ldquo;bands of the Holy Faith&rdquo;). Fra Diavolo was made leader
of one of them, and waged untiring war against the French troops,
cutting off isolated detachments and murdering stragglers and
couriers. Owing to his unrivalled knowledge of the country, he
succeeded in interrupting the enemy&rsquo;s communications between
Rome and Naples. But although, like his fellow-brigands under
Ruffo, he styled himself &ldquo;the faithful servant and subject of His
Sicilian Majesty,&rdquo; wore a military uniform and held military rank,
and was even created duke of Cassano, his atrocities were worthy
of a bandit chief. On one occasion he threw some of his prisoners,
men, women and children, over a precipice, and on another he
had a party of seventy shot. His excesses while at Albano were
such that the Neapolitan general Naselli had him arrested and
imprisoned in the castle of St Angelo, but he was liberated soon
after. When Joseph Bonaparte was made king of Naples, extraordinary
tribunals were established to suppress brigandage, and
a price was put on Fra Diavolo&rsquo;s head. After spreading terror
through Calabria, he crossed over to Sicily, where he concerted
further attacks on the French. He returned to the mainland at
the head of 200 convicts, and committed further excesses in
the Terra di Lavoro; but the French troops were everywhere
on the alert to capture him and he had to take refuge in the woods
of Lenola. For two months he evaded his pursuers, but at
length, hungry and ill, he went in disguise to the village of
Baronissi, where he was recognized and arrested, tried by an
extraordinary tribunal, condemned to death and shot. In his
last moments he cursed both the Bourbons and Admiral Sir
Sidney Smith for having induced him to engage in this reckless
adventure (1806). Although his cruelty was abominable, he
was not altogether without generosity, and by his courage and
audacity he acquired a certain romantic popularity. His name
has gained a world-wide celebrity as the title of a famous opera
by Auber.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The best known account of Fra Diavolo is in Pietro Colletta&rsquo;s
<i>Storia del reame di Napoli</i> (2nd ed., Florence, 1848); B. Amante&rsquo;s
<i>Fra Diavolo e il suo tempo</i> (Florence, 1904) is an attempted rehabilitation;
but A. Luzio, whose account in <i>Profili e bozzetti storici</i>
(Milan, 1906) gives the latest information on the subject, has demolished
Amante&rsquo;s arguments.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIAZ, NARCISSE VIRGILIO<a name="ar20" id="ar20"></a></span> (1808-1876), French painter, was
born in Bordeaux of Spanish parents, on the 25th of August 1808.
At first a figure-painter who indulged in strong colour, in his later
life Diaz became a painter of the forest and a &ldquo;tone artist&rdquo; of
the first order. He spent much time at Barbizon; and although
he is the least exalted of the half-dozen great artists who are
usually grouped round that name, he sometimes produced works
of the highest quality. At the age of ten Diaz became an orphan,
and misfortune dogged his earlier years. His foot was bitten by a
reptile in Meudon wood, near Sèvres, where he had been taken to
live with some friends of his mother. The bite was badly dressed,
and ultimately it cost him his leg. Afterwards his wooden stump
became famous. At fifteen he entered the studios at Sèvres,
where the decoration of porcelain occupied him; but tiring of the
restraint of fixed hours, he took to painting Eastern figures
dressed in richly coloured garments. Turks and Oriental scenes
attracted him, and many brilliant gems remain of this period.
About 1831 Diaz encountered Théodore Rousseau, for whom he
entertained a great veneration, although Rousseau was four years
his junior; but it was not until ten years later that the remarkable
incident took place of Rousseau teaching Diaz to paint trees.
At Fontainebleau Diaz found Rousseau painting his wonderful
forest pictures, and determined to paint in the same way if
possible. Rousseau, then in poor health, worried at home, and
embittered against the world, was difficult to approach. Diaz
followed him surreptitiously to the forest,&mdash;wooden leg not
hindering,&mdash;and he dodged round after the painter, trying to
observe his method of work. After a time Diaz found a way
to become friendly with Rousseau, and revealed his anxiety
to understand his painting. Rousseau was touched with the
passionate words of admiration, and finally taught Diaz all he
knew. Diaz exhibited many pictures at the Paris Salon, and was
decorated in 1851. During the Franco-German War he went to
Brussels. After 1871 he became fashionable, his works gradually
rose in the estimation of collectors, and he worked constantly and
successfully. In 1876 he caught cold at his son&rsquo;s grave, and on
the 18th of November of that year he died at Mentone, whither
he had gone to recruit his health. Diaz&rsquo;s finest pictures are his
forest scenes and storms, and it is on these, and not on his pretty
figures, that his fame is likely to rest. There are several fairly
good examples of the master in the Louvre, and three small figure
pictures in the Wallace collection, Hertford House. Perhaps the
most notable of Diaz&rsquo;s works are &ldquo;La Fée aux Perles&rdquo; (1857),
in the Louvre; &ldquo;Sunset in the Forest&rdquo; (1868); &ldquo;The Storm,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>172</span>
and &ldquo;The Forest of Fontainebleau&rdquo; (1870) at Leeds. Diaz
had no well-known pupils, but Léon Richet followed markedly
his methods of tree-painting, and J. F. Millet at one period
painted small figures in avowed imitation of Diaz&rsquo;s then
popular subjects.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DIAZ, PORFIRIO<a name="ar21" id="ar21"></a></span> (1830-&emsp;&emsp;), president of the republic of
Mexico (<i>q.v.</i>), was born in the southern state of Oaxaca, on the
15th of September 1830. His father was an innkeeper in the little
capital of that province, and died three years after the birth of
Porfirio, leaving a family of seven children. The boy, who had
Indian blood in his veins, was educated for the Catholic Church,
a body having immense influence in the country at that time and
ordering and controlling revolutions by the strength of their filled
coffers. Arrived at the age of sixteen Porfirio Diaz threw off the
authority of the priests. Fired with enthusiasm by stories told by
the revolutionary soldiers continually passing through Oaxaca,
and hearing about the war with the United States, a year later
he determined to set out for Mexico city and join the National
Guard. There being no trains, and he being too poor to ride, he
walked the greater part of the 250 m., but arrived there too late,
as the treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo (1848) had been already
signed, and Texas finally ceded to the United States. Thus
his entering the army was for the time defeated. Thereupon he
returned to his native town and began studying law. He took
pupils in order to pay his own fees at the Law Institute, and help
his mother. At this time he came under the notice and influence
of Don Marcos Pérez and Benito Juárez, the first a judge, the
second a governor of the state of Oaxaca, and soon to become
famous as the deliverer of Mexico from the priesthood (War of
Reform). Diaz continued in his native town until 1854, when,
refusing to vote for the dictator, Santa Anna, he was stung by a
taunt of cowardice, and hastily pushing his way to the voting
place, he recorded his vote in favour of Alvarez and the revolutionists.
Orders were given for his arrest, but seizing a rifle and
mounting a horse he placed himself at the head of a few revolting
peasants, and from that moment became one of the leading
spirits in that long struggle for reform, known as the War of
Reform, which, under the leadership of Juárez, followed the overthrow
of Santa Anna. Promotion succeeded promotion, as Diaz
led his troops from victory to victory, amid great privations and
difficulties. He was made captain (1856), lieutenant-colonel and
colonel (1859), brigadier-general (1861), and general of division
for the army (1863). Closely following on civil war, political strife,
open rebellion and the great War of Reform, came the French
invasion of 1862, and the landing of the emperor Maximilian in
1864. From the moment the French disclosed their intentions of
settling in Mexico in 1862, Diaz took a prominent part against the
foreign invasion. He was twice seriously wounded, imprisoned on
three different occasions, had two hairbreadth escapes, and took
part in many daring engagements. So important a personage did
he become that both Marshal Bazaine and the emperor Maximilian
made overtures to him. At the time of Maximilian&rsquo;s death (with
which Diaz personally had nothing to do) he was carrying on the
siege of Mexico city, which ended in the surrender of the town
two days after the emperor was shot at Quérétaro between his
two leading generals. Diaz at once set to work to pay up arrears
due to his soldiers, proclaimed death as the penalty of plunder
and theft, and in the few weeks that followed showed his great
administrative powers, the officers as well as the rank and file
receiving arrears of pay. On the very day that he occupied
Mexico city, the great commander of the army of the east, to
everyone&rsquo;s surprise, sent in his resignation. He was, indeed,
appointed to the command of the second division of the army by
President Juárez in his military reorganization, but Diaz, seeing
men who had given great and loyal service to the state dismissed
from their positions in the government, and disgusted at this
course, retired to the little city of Oaxaca; there he lived, helping
in the reorganization of the army but taking no active part in the
government until 1871.</p>

<p>On Juárez&rsquo; death Lerdo succeeded as president, in 1872. His
term of office again brought discord, and when it was known that
he was attempting to be re-elected in 1876, the storm broke.
Diaz came from retirement, took up the leadership against Lerdo,
and after desperate struggles and a daring escape finally made a
triumphal entry into Mexico city on the 24th of November 1876,
as provisional president, quickly followed by the full presidentship.
His term of office marks a prominent change in the history
of Mexico; from that date he at once forged ahead with financial
and political reform, the scrupulous settlement of all national
debts, the welding together of the peoples and tribes (there are
150 different Indian tribes) of his country, the establishment
of railroads and telegraphs, and all this in a land which had
been upheaved for a century with revolutions and bloodshed,
and which had had fifty-two dictators, presidents and rulers
in fifty-nine years. In 1880 Diaz was succeeded by Gonzalez,
the former minister of war, for four years (owing to the limit
of the presidential office), but in 1884 he was unanimously
re-elected. The government having set aside the above-mentioned
limitation, Diaz was continually re-elected to the
presidency. He married twice and had a son and two daughters.
His gifted second wife (Carmelita), very popular in Mexico, was
many years younger than himself. King Edward VII. made him
an honorary grand commander of the Bath in June 1906, in
recognition of his wonderful administration as perpetual president
for over a quarter of a century.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIAZ DE NOVAES, BARTHOLOMEU<a name="ar22" id="ar22"></a></span> (fl. 1481-1500),
Portuguese explorer, discoverer of the Cape of Good Hope, was
probably a kinsman of João Diaz, one of the first Portuguese to
round Cape Bojador (1434), and of Diniz Diaz, the discoverer
of Cape Verde (1445). In 1478 a Bartholomeu Diaz, probably
identical with the discoverer, was exempted from certain
customary payments on ivory brought from the Guinea coast.
In 1481 he commanded one of the vessels sent by King John II.
under Diogo d&rsquo;Azambuja to the Gold Coast. In 1486 he seems to
have been a cavalier of the king&rsquo;s household, and superintendent
of the royal warehouses; on the 10th of October in this year he
received an annuity of 6000 reis from King John for &ldquo;services
to come&rdquo;; and some time after this (probably about July or
August 1487, rather than July 1486, the traditional date) he left
Lisbon with three ships to carry on the work of African exploration
so greatly advanced by Diogo Cão (1482-1486). Passing
Cão&rsquo;s farthest point near Cape Cross (in the modern German
South-west Africa and) in 21° 50&prime; S., he erected a pillar on what is
now known as Diaz Point, south of Angra Pequena or Lüderitz
Bay, in 26° 38&prime; S.; of this fragments still exist. From this point
(according to De Barros) Diaz ran thirteen days southwards
before strong winds, which freshened to dangerous stormy
weather, in a comparatively high southern latitude, considerably
south of the Cape. When the storm subsided the Portuguese
stood east; and failing, after several days&rsquo; search, to find land,
turned north, and so struck the south coast of Cape Colony at
Mossel Bay (Diaz&rsquo; Bahia dos Vaqueiros), half way between the
Cape of Good Hope and Port Elizabeth (February 3, 1488). Thence
they coasted eastward, passing Algoa Bay (Diaz&rsquo; Bahia da Roca),
erecting pillars (or perhaps wooden crosses), it is said, on one of the
islands in this bay and at or near Cape Padrone farther east; of
these no traces remain. The officers and men now began to insist
on return, and Diaz could only persuade them to go as far as the
estuary of the Great Fish River (Diaz&rsquo; Rio do Iffante, so named
from his colleague, Captain João Iffante). Here, however, half way
between Port Elizabeth and East London (and indeed from
Cape Padrone), the north-easterly trend of the coast became
unmistakable; the way round Africa had been laid open. On
his return Diaz perhaps named Cape Agulhas after St Brandan;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>173</span>
while on the southernmost projection of the modern Cape
peninsula, whose remarkable highlands (Table Mountain, &amp;c.)
doubtless impressed him as the practical termination of the
continent, he bestowed, says De Barros, the name of Cape of
Storms (<i>Cabo Tormentoso</i>) in memory of the storms he had
experienced in these far southern waters; this name (in the
ordinary tradition) was changed by King John to that of Good
Hope (<i>Cabo da Boa Esperança</i>). Some excellent authorities,
however, make Diaz himself give the Cape its present name.
Hard by this &ldquo;so many ages unknown promontory&rdquo; the explorer
probably erected his last pillar. After touching at the
Ilha do Principe (Prince&rsquo;s Island, south-west of the Cameroons)
as well as at the Gold Coast, he appeared at Lisbon in December
1488. He had discovered 1260 m. of hitherto unknown coast;
and his voyage, taken with the letters soon afterwards received
from Pero de Covilhão (who by way of Cairo and Aden had
reached Malabar on one side and the &ldquo;Zanzibar coast&rdquo; on the
other as far south as Sofala, in 1487-1488) was rightly considered
to have solved the question of an ocean route round Africa to the
Indies and other lands of South and East Asia.</p>

<p>No record has yet been found of any adequate reward for Diaz:
on the contrary, when the great Indian expedition was being
prepared (for Vasco da Gama&rsquo;s future leadership) Bartolomeu
only superintended the building and outfit of the ships; when
the fleet sailed in 1497, he only accompanied da Gama to the Cape
Verde Islands, and after this was ordered to El Mina on the Gold
Coast. On Cabral&rsquo;s voyage of 1500 he was indeed permitted
to take part in the discovery of Brazil (April 22), and thence
should have helped to guide the fleet to India; but he perished
in a great storm off his own Cabo Tormentoso. Like Moses, as
Galvano says, he was allowed to see the Promised Land, but not
to enter in.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIAZO COMPOUNDS,<a name="ar23" id="ar23"></a></span> in organic chemistry, compounds of the
type R·N·<span class="su">2</span>·X (where R = a hydrocarbon radical, and X = an
acid radical or a hydroxyl group). These compounds may be
divided into two classes, namely, the true diazo compounds,
characterized by the grouping &minus;N = N&minus;, and the diazonium
compounds, characterized by the grouping N &#8758; N &lt;.</p>

<p>The diazonium compounds were first discovered by P. Griess
(<i>Ann.</i>, 1858, 106, pp. 123 et seq.), and may be prepared by the
action of nitrous fumes on a well-cooled solution of a salt of a
primary amine,</p>

<p class="center">C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span>NH<span class="su">2</span>·HNO<span class="su">3</span> + HNO<span class="su">2</span> = C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span>N<span class="su">2</span>·NO<span class="su">3</span> + 2H<span class="su">2</span>O,</p>

<p class="noind">or, as is more usually the case (since the diazonium salts
themselves are generally used only in aqueous solution) by the
addition of a well-cooled solution of potassium or sodium nitrite
to a well-cooled dilute acid solution of the primary amine. In
order to isolate the anhydrous diazonium salts, the method of
E. Knoevenagel (<i>Ber.</i>, 1890, 23, p. 2094) may be employed. In
this process the amine salt is dissolved in absolute alcohol and
diazotized by the addition of amyl nitrite; a crystalline precipitate
of the diazonium salt is formed on standing, or on the
addition of a small quantity of ether. The diazonium salts are
also formed by the action of zinc-dust and acids on the nitrates
of primary amines (R. Mohlau, <i>Ber.</i>, 1883, 16, p. 3080), and by the
action of hydroxylamine on nitrosobenzenes. They are colourless
crystalline solids which turn brown on exposure. They dissolve
easily in water, but only to a slight extent in alcohol and ether.
They are very unstable, exploding violently when heated or
rubbed. <i>Benzene diazonium nitrate</i>, C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span>N(NO<span class="su">3</span>)&#8758;N, crystallizes
in long silky needles. The sulphate and chloride are similar,
but they are not quite so unstable as the nitrate. The bromide
may be prepared by the addition of bromine to an ethereal
solution of diazo-amino-benzene (tribromaniline remaining in
solution). By the addition of potassium bromide and bromine
water to diazonium salts they are converted into a <i>perbromide</i>,
<i>e.g.</i> C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span>N<span class="su">2</span>Br<span class="su">3</span>, which crystallizes in yellow plates.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The diazonium salts are characterized by their great reactivity and
consequently are important reagents in synthetical processes, since by
their agency the amino group in a primary amine may be exchanged
for other elements or radicals. The chief reactions are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>Replacement of -NH<span class="su">2</span> by -OH</i>:&mdash;The amine is diazotized and
the aqueous solution of the diazonium salt is heated, nitrogen being
eliminated and a phenol formed.</p>

<p>2. <i>Replacement of -NH<span class="su">2</span> by halogens and by the -CN and -CNO
groups</i>:&mdash;The diazonium salt is warmed with an acid solution of the
corresponding cuprous salt (T. Sandmeyer, <i>Ber.</i>, 1884, 17, p. 2650), or
with copper powder (L. Gattermann, Ber., 1890, 23, p. 1218; 1892,
25, p. 1074). In the case of iodine, the substitution is effected by
adding a warm solution of potassium iodide to the diazonium
solution, no copper or cuprous salt being necessary; whilst for
the production of nitriles a solution of potassium cuprous cyanide is
used. This reaction (the so-called &ldquo;Sandmeyer&rdquo; reaction) has been
investigated by A. Hantzsch and J. W. Blagden (<i>Ber.</i>, 1900, 33, p. 2544),
who consider that three simultaneous reactions occur, namely, the
formation of labile double salts which decompose in such a fashion
that the radical attached to the copper atom wanders to the aromatic
nucleus; a catalytic action, in which nitrogen is eliminated and the
acid radical attaches itself to the aromatic nucleus; and finally, the
formation of azo compounds.</p>

<p>3. <i>Replacement of -NH<span class="su">2</span> by -NO<span class="su">2</span></i>:&mdash;A well-cooled concentrated
solution of potassium mercuric nitrate is added to a cooled
solution of benzene diazonium nitrate, when the crystalline salt
2C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span>N<span class="su">2</span>·NO<span class="su">3</span>, Hg(NO<span class="su">2</span>)<span class="su">2</span> is precipitated. On warming this with
copper powder, it gives a quantitative yield of nitrobenzene (A.
Hantzsch, <i>Ber.</i>, 1900, 33, p. 2551).</p>

<p>4. <i>Replacement of -NH<span class="su">2</span> by hydrogen</i>:&mdash;This exchange is brought
about, in some cases, by boiling the diazonium salt with alcohol;
but I. Remsen and his pupils (<i>Amer. Chem. Journ.</i>, 1888, 9, pp. 389
et seq.) have shown that the main product of this reaction is usually
a phenolic ether. This reaction has also been investigated by
A. Hantzsch and E. Jochem (<i>Ber.</i>, 1901, 34, p. 3337), who arrived at
the conclusion that the normal decomposition of diazonium salts
by alcohols results in the formation of phenolic ethers, but that an
increase in the molecular weight of the alcohol, or the accumulation
of negative groups in the aromatic nucleus, diminishes the yield of
the ether and increases the amount of the hydrocarbon formed. The
replacement is more readily brought about by the use of sodium
stannite (P. Friedlander, <i>Ber.</i>, 1889, 22, p. 587), or by the use of a
concentrated solution of hypophosphorous acid (J. Mai, <i>Ber.</i>, 1902, 35,
p. 162). A. Hantzsch (<i>Ber.</i>, 1896, 29, p. 947; 1898, 31, p. 1253) has shown
that the chlor- and brom- diazoniumthiocyanates, when dissolved in
alcohol containing a trace of hydrochloric acid, become converted
into the isomeric thiocyanbenzene diazonium chlorides and bromides.
This change only occurs when the halogen atom is in the ortho- or
para- position to the -N<span class="su">2</span>- group.</p>

<p><i>Metallic Diazo Derivatives.</i>&mdash;Benzene diazonium chloride is decomposed
by silver oxide in aqueous solution, with the formation of
<i>benzene diazonium hydroxide</i>, C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span>·N(OH)&#8758;N. This hydroxide,
although possessing powerful basic properties, is unstable in the
presence of alkalis and neutralizes them, being converted first into
the isomeric benzene-diazotic acid, the potassium salt of which is
obtained when the diazonium chloride is added to an excess of cold
concentrated potash (A. Hantzsch and W. B. Davidson, <i>Ber.</i>, 1898,
31, p. 1612). <i>Potassium benzene diazotate</i>, C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span>N<span class="su">2</span>·OK, crystallizes in
colourless silky needles. The free acid is not known; by the addition
of the potassium salt to 50% acetic acid at -20° C., the acid
anhydride, <i>benzene diazo oxide</i>, (C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span>N<span class="su">2</span>)<span class="su">2</span>O, is obtained as a very
unstable, yellow, insoluble compound, exploding spontaneously at
0° C. Strong acids convert it into a diazonium salt, and potash
converts it into the diazotate. On the constitution, of these anhydrides
see E. Bamberger, <i>Ber.</i>, 1896, 29, p. 446, and A. Hantzsch, <i>Ber.</i>,
1896, 29, p. 1067; 1898, 31, p. 636. By the addition of the diazonium
salts to a hot concentrated solution of a caustic alkali, C. Schraube
and C. Schmidt (<i>Ber.</i>, 1894, 27, p. 520) obtained an isomer of potassium
benzene diazotate. These <i>iso-</i>diazotates are formed much more
readily when the aromatic nucleus in the diazonium salt contains
negative radicals. <i>Potassium benzene iso-diazotate</i> resembles the
normal salt, but is more stable, and is more highly ionized. Carbon
dioxide converts it into <i>phenyl nitrosamine</i>, C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span>NH·NO
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>174</span>
(A. Hantzsch). The potassium salt of the iso-diazo hydroxide yields
on methylation a nitrogen ether, R·N(CH<span class="su">3</span>)·NO, whilst the silver salt
yields an oxygen ether, R·N:N·OCH<span class="su">3</span>. These results point to the
conclusion that the iso-diazo hydroxide is a tautomeric substance.
The same oxygen ether is formed by the methylation of the silver salt
of the normal diazo hydroxide; this points to the conclusion that the
isomeric hydroxides, corresponding with the silver derivatives, have
the same structural formulae, namely, R·N:N·OH. These oxygen
ethers contain the grouping -N:N-, since they couple very readily
with the phenols in alkaline solution to form azo compounds (<i>q.v.</i>)
(E. Bamberger, <i>Ber.</i>, 1895, 28, p. 225); they are also explosive.</p>

<p>By oxidizing potassium benzene iso-diazotate with alkaline
potassium ferricyanide, E. Bamberger (<i>Ber.</i>, 1894, 27, p. 914) obtained
the <i>diazoic acids</i>, R·NH·NO<span class="su">2</span>, substances which he had previously
prepared by similarly oxidizing the diazonium salts, by dehydrating
the nitrates of primary amines with acetic anhydride, and by the
action of nitric anhydride on the primary amines. Concentrated
acids convert them into the isomeric nitro-amines, the -NO<span class="su">2</span> group
going into the nucleus in the ortho- or para- position to the amine
nitrogen; this appears to indicate that the compounds are nitramines.
They behave, however, as tautomeric substances, since
their alkali salts on methylation give nitrogen ethers, whilst their
silver salts yield oxygen ethers:</p>

<div class="center"><img style="width:491px; height:52px" src="images/img174a.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p><i>Phenyl nitramine</i>, C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span>NH·NO<span class="su">2</span>, is a colourless crystalline solid,
which melts at 46° C. Sodium amalgam in alkaline solution reduces
it to phenylhydrazine.</p>

<p><i>Constitution of the Diazo Compounds.</i>&mdash;P. Griess (<i>Ann.</i>, 1866, 137,
p. 39) considered that the diazo compounds were formed by the addition
of complex groupings of the type C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">4</span>N<span class="su">2</span>- to the inorganic acids;
whilst A. Kekulé (<i>Zeit. f. Chemie</i>, 1866, 2, p. 308), on account of their
ready condensation to form azo compounds and their easy reduction
to hydrazines, assumed that they were substances of the type
R·N:N·Cl. The constitution of the diazonium group -N<span class="su">2</span>·X, may be
inferred from the following facts:&mdash;The group C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span>N<span class="su">2</span>- behaves in
many respects similarly to an alkali metal, and even more so to the
ammonium group, since it is capable of forming colourless neutral
salts with mineral acids, which in dilute aqueous solution are strongly
ionized, but do not show any trace of hydrolytic dissociation
(A. Hantzsch, <i>Ber.</i>, 1895, 28, p. 1734). Again, the diazonium chlorides
combine with platinic chloride to form difficultly soluble double
platinum salts, such as (C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span>N<span class="su">2</span>Cl)<span class="su">2</span>·PtCl<span class="su">4</span>; similar gold salts,
C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span>N<span class="su">2</span>Cl·AuCl<span class="su">3</span>, are known. Determinations of the electrical conductivity
of the diazonium chloride and nitrate also show that the
diazonium radical is strictly comparable with other quaternary
ammonium ions. For these reasons, one must assume the existence
of pentavalent nitrogen in the diazonium salts, in order to account
for their basic properties.</p>

<p>The constitution of the isomeric diazo hydroxides has given rise
to much discussion. E. Bamberger (<i>Ber.</i>, 1895, 28, pp. 444 et seq.) and
C. W. Blomstrand (<i>Journ. prakt. Chem.</i>, 1896, 53, pp. 169 et seq.) hold
that the compounds are structurally different, the normal diazo-hydroxide
being a diazonium derivative of the type R·N(&#8758;N)·OH.
The recent work of A. Hantzsch and his pupils seems to invalidate this
view (<i>Ber.</i>, 1894, 27, pp. 1702 et seq.; see also A. Hantzsch, <i>Die Diazoverbindungen</i>).
According to Hantzsch the isomeric diazo hydroxides
are structurally identical, and the differences in behaviour are due
to stereo-chemical relations, the isomerism being comparable with
that of the oximes (<i>q.v.</i>). On such a hypothesis, the relatively
unstable normal diazo hydroxides would be the <i>syn-</i>compounds,
since here the nitrogen atoms would be more easily eliminated, whilst
the stable iso-diazo derivatives would be the <i>anti-</i>compounds, thus:</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figcenter" colspan="2"><img style="width:323px; height:39px" src="images/img174b.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption">Normal hydroxide<br />(Syn-compound)</td>
<td class="caption">Iso hydroxide<br />(Anti-compound)</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">In support of this theory, Hantzsch has succeeded in isolating a series
of syn- and anti-diazo-cyanides and -sulphonates (<i>Ber.</i>, 1895, 28, p. 666;
1900, 33, p. 2161; 1901, 34, p. 4166). By diazotizing para-chloraniline
and adding a cold solution of potassium cyanide, a salt (melting at
29° C.) is obtained, which readily loses nitrogen, and forms para-chlorbenzonitrile
on the addition of copper powder. By dissolving
this diazocyanide in alcohol and reprecipitating it by water, it is
converted into the isomeric diazocyanide (melting at 105-106° C.),
which does not yield para-chlorbenzonitrile when treated with copper
powder. Similar results have been obtained by using diazotized
para-anisidine, a syn- and an anti- compound being formed, as well
as a third isomeric cyanide, obtained by evaporating para-methoxy-benzenediazonium
hydroxide in the presence of an excess of hydrocyanic
acid at ordinary temperatures. This salt is a colourless
crystalline substance of composition CH<span class="su">3</span>O·C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">4</span>·N<span class="su">2</span>·CN·HCN·2H<span class="su">2</span>O,
and has the properties of a metallic salt; it is very soluble in water
and its solution is an electrolyte, whereas the solutions of the syn-
and anti- compounds are not electrolytes. The isolation of these
compounds is a powerful argument in favour of the Hantzsch
hypothesis which requires the existence of these three different types,
whilst the Bamberger-Blomstrand view only accounts for the formation
of two isomeric cyanides, namely, one of the normal diazonium
type and one of the iso-diazocyanide type.</p>

<p>Benzene diazonium hydroxide, although a strong base, reacts with
the alkaline hydroxides to form salts with the evolution of heat, and
generally behaves as a weak acid. On mixing dilute solutions of the
diazonium hydroxide and the alkali together, it is found that the
molecular conductivity of the mixture is much less than the sum of
the two electrical conductivities of the solutions separately, from
which it follows that a portion of the ions present have changed to
the non-ionized condition. This behaviour is explained by considering
the non-ionized part of the diazonium hydroxide to exist in
solution in a hydrated form, the equation of equilibrium being:</p>

<div class="center"><img style="width:347px; height:52px" src="images/img174c.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="noind">On adding the alkaline hydroxide to the solution, this hydrate is
supposed to lose water, yielding the syn-diazo hydroxide, which then
gives rise to a certain amount of the sodium salt (A. Hantzsch, <i>Ber.</i>,
1898, 31, p. 1612),</p>

<div class="center"><img style="width:349px; height:58px" src="images/img174d.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="noind">This assumption also shows the relationship of the diazonium
hydroxides to other quaternary ammonium compounds, for most of
the quaternary ammonium hydroxides (except such as have the
nitrogen atom attached to four saturated hydrocarbon radicals) are
unstable, and readily pass over into compounds in which the hydroxyl
group is no longer attached to the amine nitrogen; thus the syn-diazo
hydroxides are to be regarded as pseudo-diazonium derivatives.
(A. Hantzsch, <i>Ber.</i>, 1899, 32, p. 3109; 1900, 33, p. 278.) It is generally
accepted that the iso-diazo hydroxides possess the oxime structure
R·N:N·OH.</p>

<p>Hantzsch explains the characteristic reactions of the diazonium
compounds by the assumption that an addition compound is first
formed, which breaks down with the elimination of the hydride of
the acid radical, and the formation of an unstable syn-diazo compound,
which, in its turn, decomposes with evolution of nitrogen
(<i>Ber.</i>, 1897, 30, p. 2548; 1898, 31, p. 2053).</p>

<div class="center"><img style="width:496px; height:52px" src="images/img174e.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>J. Cain (<i>Jour. Chem. Soc.</i>, 1907, 91, p. 1049) suggested a quinonoid
formula for diazonium salts, which has been combated by Hantzsch
(<i>Ber.</i>, 1908, 41, pp. 3532 et seq.). G. T. Morgan and F. M. G. Micklethwaite
(<i>Jour. Chem. Soc.</i>, 1908, 93, p. 617; 1909, 95, p. 1319) have
pointed out that the salts may possess a dynamic formula, Cain&rsquo;s
representing the middle stage, thus:</p>

<div class="center"><img style="width:292px; height:78px" src="images/img174f.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p><i>Diazoamines.</i>&mdash;The diazoamines, R·N<span class="su">2</span>·NHR, may be prepared by
the action of the primary and secondary amines on the diazonium
salts, or by the action of nitrous acid on the free primary amine. In the
latter reaction it is assumed that the isodiazohydroxide first formed
is immediately attacked by a second molecule of the amine. They
are yellow crystalline solids, which do not unite with acids. Nitrous
acid converts them, in acid solution, into diazonium salts.</p>

<p class="center">C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span>N<span class="su">2</span>·NHC<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span> + 2HCl + HNO<span class="su">2</span> = 2C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span>N<span class="su">2</span>Cl + 2H<span class="su">2</span>O.</p>

<p>They are readily converted into the isomeric aminoazo compounds,
either by standing in alcoholic solution, or by warming with a
mixture of the parent base and its hydrochloride; the diazo group
preferably going into the para-position to the amino group. When
the para-position is occupied, the diazo group takes the ortho-position.
H. Goldschmidt and R. U. Reinders (<i>Ber.</i>, 1896, 29, p. 1369,
1899) have shown that the transformation is a monomolecular
reaction, the velocity of transformation in moderately dilute solution
being independent of the concentration, but proportional to the
amount of the catalyst present (amine hydrochloride) and to the
temperature. It has also been shown that when different salts of the
amine are used, their catalytic influence varies in amount and is
almost proportional to their degree of ionization in aqueous solution.
Diazoaminobenzene, C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span>N<span class="su">2</span>·NHC<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span>, crystallizes in golden yellow
laminae, which melt at 96° C. and explode at a slightly higher temperature.
It is readily soluble in alcohol, ether and benzene. Concentrated
hydrochloric acid converts it into chlorbenzene, aniline and
nitrogen. Zinc dust and alcoholic acetic acid reduce it to aniline
and phenylhydrazine.</p>

<p><i>Diazoimino compounds</i>, R·N<span class="su">3</span>, may be regarded as derivatives of
azoimide (<i>q.v.</i>); they are formed by the action of ammonia on the
diazoperbromides, or by the action of hydroxylamine on the diazonium
sulphates (J. Mai, <i>Ber.</i>, 1892, 25, p. 372; T. Curtius, <i>Ber.</i>, 1893, 26,
p. 1271). Diazobenzeneimide, C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span>N<span class="su">3</span>, is a yellowish oil of stupefying
odour. It boils at 59° C. (12 mm.), and explodes when heated.
Concentrated hydrochloric acid decomposes it with formation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>175</span>
chloranilines and elimination of nitrogen, whilst on boiling with
sulphuric acid it is converted into aminophenols.</p>

<p><i>Aliphatic Diazo Compounds.</i>&mdash;The esters of the aliphatic amino
acids may be diazotized in a manner similar to the primary aromatic
amines, a fact discovered by T. Curtius (<i>Ber.</i>, 1833, 16, p. 2230). The
first aliphatic diazo compound to be isolated was <i>diazoacetic ester</i>,
CH·N<span class="su">2</span>·CO<span class="su">2</span>C<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">5</span>, which is prepared by the action of potassium nitrite
on the ethyl ester of glycocoll hydrochloride, HCl·NH<span class="su">2</span>·CH<span class="su">2</span>·CO<span class="su">2</span>C<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">5</span>
 + KNO<span class="su">2</span> = CHN<span class="su">2</span>·CO<span class="su">2</span>C<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">5</span> + KCl + 2H<span class="su">2</span>O. It is a yellowish oil which
melts at -24° C.; it boils at 143-144° C., but cannot be distilled safely
as it decomposes violently, giving nitrogen and ethyl fumarate. It
explodes in contact with concentrated sulphuric acid. On reduction
it yields ammonia and glycocoll (aminoacetic acid). When heated
with water it forms ethyl hydroxy-acetate; with alcohol it yields
ethyl ethoxyacetate. Halogen acids convert it into monohalogen
fatty acids, and the halogens themselves convert it into dihalogen
fatty acids. It unites with aldehydes to form esters of ketonic acids,
and with aniline yields anilido-acetic acid. It forms an addition
product with acrylic ester, which on heating loses nitrogen and leaves
trimethylene dicarboxylic ester. Concentrated ammonia converts
it into <i>diazoacetamide</i>, CHN<span class="su">2</span>·CONH<span class="su">2</span>, which crystallizes in golden
yellow plates which melt at 114° C. For other reactions see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hydrazine</a></span>. The constitution of the diazo fatty esters is inferred
from the fact that the two nitrogen atoms, when split off, are
replaced by two monovalent elements or groups, thus leading to
the formula <img style="width:146px; height:42px" src="images/img175.jpg" alt="" /> for diazoacetic ester.</p>

<p><i>Diazosuccinic ester</i>, N<span class="su">2</span>·C(CO<span class="su">2</span>C<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">5</span>)<span class="su">2</span>, is similarly prepared by the
action of nitrous acid on the hydrochloride of aspartic ester. It is
decomposed by boiling water and yields fumaric ester.</p>

<p><i>Diazomethane</i>, CH<span class="su">2</span>N<span class="su">2</span>, was first obtained in 1894 by H. v. Pechmann
(<i>Ber.</i>, 1894, 27, p. 1888; 1895, 28, p. 855). It is prepared by the
action of aqueous or alcoholic solutions of the caustic alkalis on
the nitroso-acidyl derivatives of methylamine (such, for example,
as <i>nitrosomethyl urethane</i>, NO·N(CH<span class="su">3</span>)·CO<span class="su">2</span>C<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">5</span>, which is formed on
passing nitrous fumes into an ethereal solution of methyl urethane).
E. Bamberger (<i>Ber.</i>, 1895, 28, p. 1682) regards it as the anhydride of
iso-diazomethane, CH<span class="su">3</span>·N:N·OH, and has prepared it by a method
similar to that used for the preparation of iso-diazobenzene. By the
action of bleaching powder on methylamine hydrochloride, there
is obtained a volatile liquid (<i>methyldichloramine</i>, CH<span class="su">3</span>·N·Cl<span class="su">2</span>), boiling
at 58-60° C., which explodes violently when heated with water,
yielding hydrocyanic acid (CH<span class="su">3</span>NCl<span class="su">2</span> = HCN + 2HCl). Well-dried
hydroxylamine hydrochloride is dissolved in methyl alcohol and
mixed with sodium methylate; a solution of methyldichloramine in
absolute ether is then added and an ethereal solution of diazomethane
distils over. Diazomethane is a yellow inodorous gas, very poisonous
and corrosive. It may be condensed to a liquid, which boils at about
0° C. It is a powerful methylating agent, reacting with water to form
methyl alcohol, and converting acetic acid into methylacetate, hydrochloric
acid into methyl chloride, hydrocyanic acid into acetonitrile,
and phenol into anisol, nitrogen being eliminated in each case. It is
reduced by sodium amalgam (in alcoholic solution) to <i>methylhydrazine</i>,
CH<span class="su">3</span>·NH·NH<span class="su">2</span>. It unites directly with acetylene to form pyrazole
(H. v. Pechmann, <i>Ber.</i>, 1898, 31, p. 2950) and with fumaric methyl
ester it forms pyrazolin dicarboxylic ester.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIBDIN, CHARLES<a name="ar25" id="ar25"></a></span> (1745-1814), British musician, dramatist,
novelist, actor and song-writer, the son of a parish clerk, was born
at Southampton on or before the 4th of March 1745, and was the
youngest of a family of eighteen. His parents designing him for
the church, he was sent to Winchester; but his love of music
early diverted his thoughts from the clerical profession. After
receiving some instruction from the organist of Winchester
cathedral, where he was a chorister from 1756 to 1759, he went
to London at the age of fifteen. Here he was placed in a music
warehouse in Cheapside, but he soon abandoned this employment
to become a singing actor at Covent Garden. On the 21st of May
1762 his first work, an operetta entitled <i>The Shepherd&rsquo;s Artifice</i>,
with words and music by himself, was produced at this theatre.
Other works followed, his reputation being firmly established
by the music to the play of <i>The Padlock</i>, produced at Drury Lane
under Garrick&rsquo;s management in 1768, the composer himself taking
the part of Mungo with conspicuous success. He continued for
some years to be connected with Drury Lane, both as composer
and as actor, and produced during this period two of his best
known works, <i>The Waterman</i> (1774) and <i>The Quaker</i> (1775). A
quarrel with Garrick led to the termination of his engagement.
In <i>The Comic Mirror</i> he ridiculed prominent contemporary figures
through the medium of a puppet show. In 1782 he became joint
manager of the Royal circus, afterwards known as the Surrey
theatre. In three years he lost this position owing to a quarrel
with his partner. His opera <i>Liberty Hall</i>, containing the successful
songs &ldquo;Jock Ratlin,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Highmettled Racer,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The Bells of Aberdovey,&rdquo; was produced at Drury Lane theatre
on the 8th of February 1785. In 1788 he sailed for the East
Indies, but the vessel having put in to Torbay in stress of weather,
he changed his mind and returned to London. In a musical
variety entertainment called <i>The Oddities</i>, he succeeded in winning
marked popularity with a number of songs that included
&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas in the good ship &lsquo;Rover&rsquo;,&rdquo; &ldquo;Saturday Night at Sea,&rdquo; &ldquo;I
sailed from the Downs in the &lsquo;Nancy,&rsquo;&rdquo; and the immortal &ldquo;Tom
Bowling,&rdquo; written on the death of his eldest brother, Captain
Thomas Dibdin, at whose invitation he had planned his visit
to India. A series of monodramatic entertainments which he
gave at his theatre, Sans Souci, in Leicester Square, brought his
songs, music and recitations more prominently into notice, and
permanently established his fame as a lyric poet. It was at these
entertainments that he first introduced many of those sea-songs
which so powerfully influenced the national spirit. The words
breathe the simple loyalty and dauntless courage that are the
cardinal virtues of the British sailor, and the music was appropriate
and naturally melodious. Their effect in stimulating
and ennobling the spirit of the navy during the war with France
was so marked as to call for special acknowledgment. In 1803
Dibdin was rewarded by government with a pension of £200 a
year, of which he was only for a time deprived under the administration
of Lord Grenville. During this period he opened a
music shop in the Strand, but the venture was a failure. Dibdin
died of paralysis in London on the 25th of July 1814. Besides his
<i>Musical Tour through England</i> (1788), his <i>Professional Life</i>, an
autobiography published in 1803, a <i>History of the Stage</i> (1795), and
several smaller works, he wrote upwards of 1400 songs and about
thirty dramatic pieces. He also wrote the following novels:&mdash;<i>The
Devil</i> (1785); <i>Hannah Hewitt</i> (1792); <i>The Younger Brother</i>
(1793). An edition of his songs by G. Hogarth (1843) contains
a memoir of his life. His two sons, Charles and Thomas John
Dibdin (<i>q.v.</i>), whose works are often confused with those of their
father, were also popular dramatists in their day.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DIBDIN, THOMAS FROGNALL<a name="ar26" id="ar26"></a></span> (1776-1847), English bibliographer,
born at Calcutta in 1776, was the son of Thomas Dibdin,
the sailor brother of Charles Dibdin. His father and mother both
died on the way home to England in 1780, and Thomas was
brought up by a maternal uncle. He was educated at St John&rsquo;s
College, Oxford, and studied for a time at Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn. After
an unsuccessful attempt to obtain practice as a provincial counsel
at Worcester, he was ordained a clergyman at the close of 1804,
being appointed to a curacy at Kensington. It was not until
1823 that he received the living of Exning in Sussex. Soon afterwards
he was appointed by Lord Liverpool to the rectory of St
Mary&rsquo;s, Bryanston Square, which he held until his death on the
18th of November 1847. The first of his numerous bibliographical
works was his <i>Introduction to the Knowledge of Editions of the
Classics</i> (1802), which brought him under the notice of the
third Earl Spencer, to whom he owed much important aid in
his bibliographical pursuits. The rich library at Althorp was
thrown open to him; he spent much of his time in it, and in
1814-1815 published his <i>Bibliotheca Spenceriana</i>. As the library
was not open to the general public, the information given in the
<i>Bibliotheca</i> was found very useful, but since its author was unable
even to read the characters in which the books he described were
written, the work was marred by the errors which more or less
characterize all his productions. This fault of inaccuracy however
was less obtrusive in his series of playful, discursive works in
the form of dialogues on his favourite subject, the first of which,
<i>Bibliomania</i> (1809), was republished with large additions in
1811, and was very popular, passing through numerous editions.
To the same class belonged the <i>Bibliographical Decameron</i>, a larger
work, which appeared in 1817. In 1810 he began the publication
of a new and much extended edition of Ames&rsquo;s <i>Typographical
Antiquities</i>. The first volume was a great success, but the publication
was checked by the failure of the fourth volume, and was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>176</span>
never completed. In 1818 Dibdin was commissioned by Earl
Spencer to purchase books for him on the continent, an expedition
described in his sumptuous <i>Bibliographical, Antiquarian and
Picturesque Tour in France and Germany</i> (1821). In 1824 he
made an ambitious venture in his <i>Library Companion, or the
Young Man&rsquo;s Guide and Old Man&rsquo;s Comfort in the Choice of a
Library</i>, intended to point out the best works in all departments
of literature. His culture was not broad enough, however, to
render him competent for the task, and the work was severely
criticized. For some years Dibdin gave himself up chiefly to
religious literature. He returned to bibliography in his
<i>Bibliophobia, or Remarks on the Present Depression in the State of
Literature and the Book Trade</i> (1832), and the same subject
furnishes the main interest of his <i>Reminiscences of a Literary Life</i>
(1836), and his <i>Bibliographical, Antiquarian and Picturesque
Tour in the Northern Counties of England and Scotland</i> (1838).
Dibdin was the originator and vice-president, Lord Spencer
being the president, of the Roxburghe Club, founded in 1812,&mdash;the
first of the numerous book clubs which have done such
service to literature.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIBDIN, THOMAS JOHN<a name="ar27" id="ar27"></a></span> (1771-1841), English dramatist and
song-writer, son of Charles Dibdin, the song-writer, and of Mrs
Davenet, an actress whose real name was Harriet Pitt, was born
on the 21st of March 1771. He was apprenticed to his maternal
uncle, a London upholsterer, and later to William Rawlins,
afterwards sheriff of London. He summoned his second master
unsuccessfully for rough treatment; and after a few years of
service he ran away to join a company of country players. From
1789 to 1795 he played in all sorts of parts; he acted as scene
painter at Liverpool in 1791; and during this period he composed
more than 1000 songs. He made his first attempt as a
dramatic writer in <i>Something New</i>, followed by <i>The Mad Guardian</i>
in 1795. He returned to London in 1795, having married two
years before; and in the winter of 1798-1799 his <i>Jew and the
Doctor</i> was produced at Covent Garden. From this time he
contributed a very large number of comedies, operas, farces, &amp;c.,
to the public entertainment. Some of these brought immense
popularity to the writer and immense profits to the theatres. It is
stated that the pantomime of <i>Mother Goose</i> (1807) produced more
than £20,000 for the management at Covent Garden theatre, and
the <i>High-mettled Racer</i>, adapted as a pantomime from his father&rsquo;s
play, £18,000 at Astley&rsquo;s. Dibdin was prompter and pantomime
writer at Drury Lane until 1816, when he took the Surrey theatre.
This venture proved disastrous and he became bankrupt. After
this he was manager of the Haymarket, but without his old
success, and his last years were passed in comparative poverty.
In 1827 he published two volumes of <i>Reminiscences</i>; and at the
time of his death he was preparing an edition of his father&rsquo;s sea
songs, for which a small sum was allowed him weekly by the lords
of the admiralty. Of his own songs &ldquo;The Oak Table&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The Snug Little Island&rdquo; are well-known examples. He died in
London on the 16th of September 1841.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DICAEARCHUS,<a name="ar30" id="ar30"></a></span> of Messene in Sicily, Peripatetic philosopher
and pupil of Aristotle, historian, and geographer, flourished about
320 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> He was a friend of Theophrastus, to whom he dedicated
the majority of his works. Of his writings, which comprised
treatises on a great variety of subjects, only the titles and a few
fragments survive. The most important of them was his
<span class="grk" title="bios tês Hellados">&#946;&#943;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#904;&#955;&#955;&#940;&#948;&#959;&#962;</span> (<i>Life in Greece</i>), in which the moral, political
and social condition of the people was very fully discussed. In
his <i>Tripoliticos</i> he described the best form of government as a
mixture of monarchy, aristocracy and democracy, and illustrated
it by the example of Sparta. Among the philosophical works of
Dicaearchus may be mentioned the <i>Lesbiaci</i>, a dialogue in three
books, in which the author endeavours to prove that the soul is
mortal, to which he added a supplement called <i>Corinthiaci</i>. He
also wrote a <i>Description of the World</i> illustrated by maps, in
which was probably included his <i>Measurements of Mountains</i>.
A description of Greece (150 iambics, in C. Müller, <i>Frag. hist.
Graec</i>. i. 238-243) was formerly attributed to him, but, as the
initial letters of the first twenty-three lines show, was really
the work of Dionysius, son of Calliphon. Three considerable
fragments of a prose description of Greece (Müller, i. 97-110)
are now assigned to an unknown author named Heracleides. The
<i>De re publica</i> of Cicero is supposed to be founded on one of
Dicaearchus&rsquo;s works.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DICE<a name="ar31" id="ar31"></a></span> (plural of die, O. Fr. <i>de</i>, derived from Lat. <i>dare</i>, to give),
small cubes of ivory, bone, wood or metal, used in gaming. The
six sides of a die are each marked with a different number of
incised dots in such a manner that the sum of the dots on any two
opposite sides shall be 7. Dice seem always to have been
employed, as is the case to-day, for gambling purposes, and they
are also used in such games as backgammon. There are many
methods of playing, from one to five dice being used, although
two or three are the ordinary numbers employed in Great Britain
and America. The dice are thrown upon a table or other smooth
surface either from the hand or from a receptacle called a dice-box,
the latter method having been in common use in Greece, Rome
and the Orient in ancient times. Dice-boxes have been made in
many shapes and of various materials, such as wood, leather,
agate, crystal, metal or paper. Many contain bars within to ensure
a proper agitation of the dice, and thus defeat trickery. Some,
formerly used in England, were employed with unmarked dice,
and allowed the cubes to fall through a kind of funnel upon a
board marked off into six equal parts numbered from 1 to 6.
It is a remarkable fact, that, wherever dice have been found,
whether in the tombs of ancient Egypt, of classic Greece, or of
the far East, they differ in no material respect from those in use
to-day, the elongated ones with rounded ends found in Roman
graves having been, not dice but <i>tali</i>, or knucklebones. Eight-sided
dice have comparatively lately been introduced in France
as aids to children in learning the multiplication table. The
teetotum, or spinning die, used in many modern games, was
known in ancient times in China and Japan. The increased
popularity of the more elaborate forms of gaming has resulted in
the decline of dicing. The usual method is to throw three times
with three dice. If one or more sixes or fives are thrown the first
time they may be reserved, the other throws being made with the
dice that are left. The object is to throw three sixes = 18 or as
near that number as possible, the highest throw winning, or, when
drinks are to be paid for, the lowest throw losing. (For other
methods of throwing consult the <i>Encyclopaedia of Indoor Games</i>,
by R. F. Foster, 1903.) The most popular form of pure gambling
with dice at the present day, particularly with the lower classes in
America, is <i>Craps</i>, or <i>Crap-Shooting</i>, a simple form of <i>Hazard</i>, of
French origin. Two dice are used. Each player puts up a stake
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>177</span>
and the first caster may cover any or all of the bets. He then
<i>shoots</i>, <i>i.e.</i> throws the dice from his open hand upon the table.
If the sum of the dice is 7 or 11 the throw is a <i>nick</i>, or <i>natural</i>, and
the caster wins all stakes. If the throw is either 2, 3 or 12 it is
a <i>crap</i>, and the caster loses all. If any other number is thrown
it is a <i>point</i>, and the caster continues until he throws the same
number again, in which case he wins, or a 7, in which case he
loses. The now practically obsolete game of Hazard was much
more complicated than <i>Craps</i>. (Consult <i>The Game of Hazard
Investigated</i>, by George Lowbut.) <i>Poker dice</i> are marked with ace,
king, queen, jack and ten-spot. Five are used and the object is,
in three throws, to make pairs, triplets, full hands or fours and
fives of a kind, five aces being the highest hand. Straights do
not count. In throwing to decide the payment of drinks the
usual method is called <i>horse and horse</i>, in which the highest
throws retire, leaving the two lowest to decide the loser by the
best two in three throws. Should each player win one throw
both are said to be <i>horse and horse</i>, and the next throw determines
the loser. The two last casters may also agree to <i>sudden death</i>, <i>i.e.</i>
a single throw. <i>Loaded dice</i>, <i>i.e.</i> dice weighted slightly on the side
of the lowest number, have been used by swindlers from the very
earliest times to the present day, a fact proved by countless
literary allusions. Modern dice are often rounded at the corners,
which are otherwise apt to wear off irregularly.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Dice were probably evolved from knucklebones.
The antiquary Thomas Hyde, in his <i>Syntagma</i>, records his
opinion that the game of &ldquo;odd or even,&rdquo; played with pebbles, is
nearly coeval with the creation of man. It is almost impossible
to trace clearly the development of dice as distinguished from
knucklebones, on account of the confusing of the two games
by the ancient writers. It is certain, however, that both were
played in times antecedent to those of which we possess any
written records. Sophocles, in a fragment, ascribed their invention
to Palamedes, a Greek, who taught them to his countrymen
during the siege of Troy, and who, according to Pausanias
(on Corinth, xx.), made an offering of them on the altar of the
temple of Fortune. Herodotus (<i>Clio</i>) relates that the Lydians,
during a period of famine in the days of King Atys, invented dice,
knucklebones and indeed all other games except chess. The fact
that dice have been used throughout the Orient from time
immemorial, as has been proved by excavations from ancient
tombs, seems to point clearly to an Asiatic origin. Dicing is
mentioned as an Indian game in the <i>Rig-veda</i>. In its primitive
form knucklebones was essentially a game of skill, played by
women and children, while dice were used for gambling, and
it was doubtless the gambling spirit of the age which was
responsible for the derivative form of knucklebones, in which
four sides of the bones received different values, which were then
counted, like dice. Gambling with three, sometimes two, dice
(<span class="grk" title="kuboi">&#954;&#973;&#946;&#959;&#953;</span>) was a very popular form of amusement in Greece, especially
with the upper classes, and was an almost invariable accompaniment
to the symposium, or drinking banquet. The dice were cast
from conical beakers, and the highest throw was three sixes,
called <i>Aphrodite</i>, while the lowest, three aces, was called the <i>dog</i>.
Both in Greece and Rome different modes of counting were in
vogue. Roman dice were called <i>tesserae</i> from the Greek word for
four, indicative of the four sides. The Romans were passionate
gamblers, especially in the luxurious days of the Empire, and
dicing was a favourite form, though it was forbidden except
during the Saturnalia. The emperor Augustus wrote in a letter
to Suetonius concerning a game that he had played with his
friends: &ldquo;Whoever threw a <i>dog</i> or a six paid a <i>denarius</i> to the
bank for every die, and whoever threw a <i>Venus</i> (the highest) won
everything.&rdquo; In the houses of the rich the dice-beakers were
of carved ivory and the dice of crystal inlaid with gold. Mark
Antony wasted his time at Alexandria with dicing, while, according
to Suetonius, the emperors Augustus, Nero and Claudius were
passionately fond of it, the last named having written a book on
the game. Caligula notoriously cheated at the game; Domitian
played it, and Commodus set apart special rooms in his palace
for it. The emperor Verus, adopted son of Antonine, is known
to have thrown dice whole nights together. Fashionable society
followed the lead of its emperors, and, in spite of the severity of
the laws, fortunes were squandered at the dicing table. Horace
derided the youth of the period, who wasted his time amid the
dangers of dicing instead of taming his charger and giving himself
up to the hardships of the chase. Throwing dice for money
was the cause of many special laws in Rome, according to one of
which no suit could be brought by a person who allowed gambling
in his house, even if he had been cheated or assaulted. Professional
gamblers were common, and some of their loaded dice
are preserved in museums. The common public-houses were the
resorts of gamblers, and a fresco is extant showing two quarrelling
dicers being ejected by the indignant host. Virgil, in the <i>Copa</i>
generally ascribed to him, characterizes the spirit of that age in
verse, which has been Englished as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;What ho! Bring dice and good wine!</p>
<p class="i2">Who cares for the morrow?</p>
<p class="i05">Live&mdash;so calls grinning Death&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Live, for I come to you soon!&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">That the barbarians were also given to gaming, whether or
not they learned it from their Roman conquerors, is proved by
Tacitus, who states that the Germans were passionately fond
of dicing, so much so, indeed, that, having lost everything, they
would even stake their personal liberty. Centuries later, during
the middle ages, dicing became the favourite pastime of the
knights, and both dicing schools (<i>scholae deciorum</i>) and gilds
of dicers existed. After the downfall of feudalism the famous
German mercenaries called <i>landsknechts</i> established a reputation
as the most notorious dicing gamblers of their time. Many of the
dice of the period were curiously carved in the images of men and
beasts. In France both knights and ladies were given to dicing,
which repeated legislation, including interdictions on the part of
St Louis in 1254 and 1256, did not abolish. In Japan, China,
Korea, India and other Asiatic countries dice have always been
popular and are so still.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DICETO, RALPH DE<a name="ar32" id="ar32"></a></span> (d. c. 1202), dean of St Paul&rsquo;s, London,
and chronicler, is first mentioned in 1152, when he received the
archdeaconry of Middlesex. He was probably born between
1120 and 1130; of his parentage and nationality we know
nothing. The common statement that he derived his surname
from Diss in Norfolk is a mere conjecture; Dicetum may equally
well be a Latinized form of Dissai, or Dicy, or Dizy, place names
which are found in Maine, Picardy, Burgundy and Champagne.
In 1152 Diceto was already a master of arts; presumably he had
studied at Paris. His reputation for learning and integrity stood
high; he was regarded with respect and favour by Arnulf of
Lisieux and Gilbert Foliot of Hereford (afterwards of London),
two of the most eminent bishops of their time. Quite naturally,
the archdeacon took in the Becket question the same side as his
friends. Although his narrative is colourless, and although he
was one of those who showed some sympathy for Becket at the
council of Northampton (1164), the correspondence of Diceto
shows that he regarded the archbishop&rsquo;s conduct as ill-considered,
and that he gave advice to those whom Becket regarded as his
chief enemies. Diceto was selected, in 1166, as the envoy of the
English bishops when they protested against the excommunications
launched by Becket. But, apart from this episode, which he
characteristically omits to record, he remained in the background.
The natural impartiality of his intellect was accentuated by a
certain timidity, which is apparent in his writings no less than
in his life. About 1180 he became dean of St Paul&rsquo;s. In this
office he distinguished himself by careful management of the
estates, by restoring the discipline of the chapter, and by building
at his own expense a deanery-house. A scholar and a man of
considerable erudition, he showed a strong preference for historical
studies; and about the time when he was preferred to
the deanery he began to collect materials for the history of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>178</span>
own times. His friendships with Richard Fitz Nigel, who succeeded
Foliot in the see of London, with William Longchamp, the
chancellor of Richard I., and with Walter of Coutances, the archbishop
of Rouen, gave him excellent opportunities of collecting
information. His two chief works, the <i>Abbreviationes Chronicorum</i>
and the <i>Ymagines Historiarum</i>, cover the history of the
world from the birth of Christ to the year 1202. The former,
which ends in 1147, is a work of learning and industry, but
almost entirely based upon extant sources. The latter, beginning
as a compilation from Robert de Monte and the letters of
Foliot, becomes an original authority about 1172, and a contemporary
record about 1181. In precision and fulness of detail the
<i>Ymagines</i> are inferior to the chronicles of the so-called Benedict
and of Hoveden. Though an annalist, Diceto is careless in his
chronology; and the documents which he incorporates, while
often important, are selected on no principle. He has little sense
of style; but displays considerable insight when he ventures to
discuss a political situation. For this reason, and on account of
the details with which they supplement the more important
chronicles of the period, the <i>Ymagines</i> are a valuable though a
secondary source.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DICEY, EDWARD<a name="ar33" id="ar33"></a></span> (1832-&emsp;&emsp;), English writer, son of T. E.
Dicey of Claybrook Hall, Leicestershire, was born in 1832. Educated
at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he took mathematical
and classical honours, he became an active journalist, contributing
largely to the principal reviews. He was called to the bar
in 1875, became a bencher of Gray&rsquo;s Inn in 1896, and was
treasurer in 1903-1904. He was connected with the <i>Daily
Telegraph</i> as leader writer and then as special correspondent, and
after a short spell in 1870 as editor of the <i>Daily News</i> he became
editor of the <i>Observer</i>, a position which he held until 1889. Of
his many books on foreign affairs perhaps the most important are
his <i>England and Egypt</i> (1884), <i>Bulgaria, the Peasant State</i> (1895),
<i>The Story of the Khedivate</i> (1902), and <i>The Egypt of the Future</i>
(1907). He was created C.B. in 1886.</p>

<p>His brother <span class="sc">Albert Venn Dicey</span> (b. 1835), English jurist,
was educated at Balliol College, Oxford, where he took a first
class in the classical schools in 1858. He was called to the bar at
the Inner Temple in 1863. He held fellowships successively
at Balliol, Trinity and All Souls&rsquo;, and from 1882 to 1909 was
Vinerian professor of law. He became Q.C. in 1890. His chief
works are the <i>Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution</i>
(1885, 6th ed. 1902), which ranks as a standard work on
the subject; <i>England&rsquo;s Case against Home Rule</i> (1886); <i>A Digest

and <i>Lectures on the Relation between Law and Public Opinion in

cutting asunder, the technical term for a form of logical division,
consisting in the separation of a genus into two species, one of
which has and the other has not, a certain quality or attribute.
Thus men may be thus divided into white men, and men who are
not white; each of these may be subdivided similarly. On the
principle of contradiction this division is both exhaustive and
exclusive; there can be no overlapping, and no members of the
original genus or the lower groups are omitted. This method of
classification, though formally accurate, has slight value in the
exact sciences, partly because at every step one of the two groups
is merely negatively characterized and therefore incapable of real
subdivision; it is useful, however, in setting forth clearly the
gradual descent from the most inclusive genus (<i>summum genus</i>)
through species to the lowest class (<i>infima species</i>), which is
divisible only into individual persons or things. (See further

moon or of a planet when apparently half illuminated, so that its
disk has the form of a semicircle.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DICK, ROBERT<a name="ar35" id="ar35"></a></span> (1811-1866), Scottish geologist and botanist,
was born at Tullibody, in Clackmannanshire, in January 1811.
His father was an officer of excise. At the age of thirteen, after
receiving a good elementary education at the parish school,
Robert Dick was apprenticed to a baker, and served for three
years. In these early days he became interested in wild flowers&mdash;he
made a collection of plants and gradually acquired some
knowledge of their names from an old encyclopaedia. When
his time was out he left Tullibody and gained employment as a
journeyman baker at Leith, Glasgow and Greenock. Meanwhile
his father, who in 1826 had been removed to Thurso, as supervisor
of excise, advised his son to set up a baker&rsquo;s shop in that
town. Thither Robert Dick went in 1830, he started in business
as a baker and worked laboriously until he died on the 24th of
December 1866. Throughout this period he zealously devoted
himself to studying and collecting the plants, mollusca and insects
of a wide area of Caithness, and his attention was directed soon
after he settled in Thurso to the rocks and fossils. In 1835 he first
found remains of fossil fishes; but it was not till some years later
that his interest became greatly stirred. Then he obtained a copy
of Hugh Miller&rsquo;s <i>Old Red Sandstone</i> (published in 1841), and
he began systematically to collect with hammer and chisel the
fossils from the Caithness flags. In 1845 he found remains of
<i>Holoptychius</i> and forwarded specimens to Hugh Miller, and he
continued to send the best of his fossil fishes to that geologist, and
to others after the death of Miller. In this way he largely contributed
to the progress of geological knowledge, although he himself
published nothing and was ever averse from publicity. His
herbarium, which consisted of about 200 folios of mosses, ferns
and flowering plants &ldquo;almost unique in its completeness,&rdquo; is now
stored, with many of his fossils, in the museum at Thurso. Dick
had a hard struggle for existence, especially through competition
during his late years, when he was reduced almost to beggary:
but of this few, if any, of his friends were aware until it was
too late. A monument erected in the new cemetery at Thurso
testifies to the respect which his life-work created, when the
merits of this enthusiastic naturalist came to be appreciated.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DICK, THOMAS<a name="ar36" id="ar36"></a></span> (1774-1857), Scottish writer on astronomy,
was born at Dundee on the 24th of November 1774. The
appearance of a brilliant meteor inspired him, when in his ninth
year, with a passion for astronomy; and at the age of sixteen he
forsook the loom, and supported himself by teaching. In 1794
he entered the university of Edinburgh, and set up a school on the
termination of his course; then, in 1801, took out a licence to
preach, and officiated for some years as probationer in the
United Presbyterian church. From about 1807 to 1817 he taught
in the secession school at Methven in Perthshire, and during the
ensuing decade in that of Perth, where he composed his first
substantive book, <i>The Christian Philosopher</i> (1823, 8th ed. 1842).
Its success determined his vocation as an author; he built
himself, in 1827, a cottage at Broughty Ferry, near Dundee, and
devoted himself wholly to literary and scientific pursuits. They
proved, however, owing to his unpractical turn of mind, but
slightly remunerative, and he was in 1847 relieved from actual
poverty by a crown pension of £50 a year, eked out by a local
subscription. He died on the 29th of July 1857. His best-known
works are: <i>Celestial Scenery</i> (1837), <i>The Sidereal Heavens</i>
(1840), and <i>The Practical Astronomer</i> (1845), in which is contained
(p. 204) a remarkable forecast of the powers and uses of
celestial photography. Written with competent knowledge, and
in an agreeable style, they obtained deserved and widespread
popularity.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DICKENS, CHARLES JOHN HUFFAM<a name="ar37" id="ar37"></a></span> (1812-1870), English
novelist, was born on the 7th of February 1812 at a house in
the Mile End Terrace, Commercial Road, Landport (Portsea)&mdash;a
house which was opened as a Dickens Museum on 22nd July 1904.
His father John Dickens (d. 1851), a clerk in the navy-pay office
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>179</span>
on a salary of £80 a year, and stationed for the time being at
Portsmouth, had married in 1809 Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas
Barrow, and she bore him a family of eight children, Charles
being the second. In the winter of 1814 the family moved
from Portsea in the snow, as he remembered, to London, and
lodged for a time near the Middlesex hospital. The country
of the novelist&rsquo;s childhood, however, was the kingdom of Kent,
where the family was established in proximity to the dockyard
at Chatham from 1816 to 1821. He looked upon himself in later
years as a man of Kent, and his capital abode as that in Ordnance
Terrace, or 18 St Mary&rsquo;s Place, Chatham, amid surroundings
classified in Mr Pickwick&rsquo;s notes as &ldquo;appearing&rdquo; to be soldiers,
sailors, Jews, chalk, shrimps, officers and dockyard men. He fell
into a family the general tendency of which was to go down in
the world, during one of its easier periods (John Dickens was
now fifth clerk on £250 a year), and he always regarded himself
as belonging by right to a comfortable, genteel, lower middle-class
stratum of society. His mother taught him to read; to his
father he appeared very early in the light of a young prodigy, and
by him Charles was made to sit on a tall chair and warble popular
ballads, or even to tell stories and anecdotes for the benefit of
fellow-clerks in the office. John Dickens, however, had a small
collection of books which were kept in a little room upstairs
that led out of Charles&rsquo;s own, and in this attic the boy found
his true literary instructors in <i>Roderick Random</i>, <i>Peregrine
Pickle</i>, <i>Humphry Clinker</i>, <i>Tom Jones</i>, <i>The Vicar of Wakefield</i>,
<i>Don Quixote</i>, <i>Gil Blas</i> and <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>. The story of how he
played at the characters in these books and sustained his idea of
Roderick Random for a month at a stretch is picturesquely told
in <i>David Copperfield</i>. Here as well as in his first and last books
and in what many regard as his best, <i>Great Expectations</i>, Dickens
returns with unabated fondness and mastery to the surroundings
of his childhood. From seven to nine years he was at a
school kept in Clover Lane, Chatham, by a Baptist minister
named William Giles, who gave him Goldsmith&rsquo;s <i>Bee</i> as a keepsake
when the call to Somerset House necessitated the removal
of the family from Rochester to a shabby house in Bayham Street,
Camden Town. At the very moment when a consciousness of
capacity was beginning to plump his youthful ambitions, the
whole flattering dream vanished and left not a rack behind.
Happiness and Chatham had been left behind together, and
Charles was about to enter a school far sterner and also far
more instructive than that in Clover Lane. The family income
had been first decreased and then mortgaged; the creditors of
the &ldquo;prodigal father&rdquo; would not give him time; John Dickens
was consigned to the Marshalsea; Mrs Dickens started an
&ldquo;Educational Establishment&rdquo; as a forlorn hope in Upper Gower
Street; and Charles, who had helped his mother with the children,
blacked the boots, carried things to the pawnshop and done
other menial work, was now sent out to earn his own living as a
young hand in a blacking warehouse, at Old Hungerford Stairs, on
a salary of six shillings a week. He tied, trimmed and labelled
blacking pots for over a year, dining off a saveloy and a slice of
pudding, consorting with two very rough boys, Bob Fagin and
Pol Green, and sleeping in an attic in Little College Street,
Camden Town, in the house of Mrs Roylance (Pipchin), while on
Sunday he spent the day with his parents in their comfortable
prison, where they had the services of a &ldquo;marchioness&rdquo; imported
from the Chatham workhouse.</p>

<p>Already consumed by ambition, proud, sensitive and on his
dignity to an extent not uncommon among boys of talent, he felt
his position keenly, and in later years worked himself up into a
passion of self-pity in connexion with the &ldquo;degradation&rdquo; and
&ldquo;humiliation&rdquo; of this episode. The two years of childish hardship
which ate like iron into his soul were obviously of supreme
importance in the growth of the novelist. Recollections of the
streets and the prison and its purlieus supplied him with a store
of literary material upon which he drew through all the years of
his best activity. And the bitterness of such an experience was
not prolonged sufficiently to become sour. From 1824 to 1826,
having been rescued by a family quarrel and by a windfall in the
shape of a legacy to his father, from the warehouse, he spent two
years at an academy known as Wellington House, at the corner
of Granby Street and the Hampstead Road (the lighter traits of
which are reproduced in Salem House), and was there known as
a merry and rather mischievous boy. Fortunately he learned
nothing there to compromise the results of previous instruction.
His father had now emerged from the Marshalsea and was seeking
employment as a parliamentary reporter. A Gray&rsquo;s Inn solicitor
with whom he had had dealings was attracted by the bright,
clever look of Charles, and took him into his office as a boy at
a salary of thirteen and sixpence (rising to fifteen shillings) a
week. He remained in Mr Blackmore&rsquo;s office from May 1827 to
November 1828, but he had lost none of his eager thirst for distinction,
and spent all his spare time mastering Gurney&rsquo;s shorthand
and reading early and late at the British Museum. A more
industrious apprentice in the lower grades of the literary profession
has never been known, and the consciousness of opportunities
used to the most splendid advantage can hardly have been absent
from the man who was shortly to take his place at the head of it
as if to the manner born. Lowten and Guppy, and Swiveller
had been observed from this office lad&rsquo;s stool; he was now
greatly to widen his area of study as a reporter in Doctors&rsquo;
Commons and various police courts, including Bow Street,
working all day at law and much of the night at shorthand. Some
one asked John Dickens, during the first eager period of curiosity
as to the man behind &ldquo;Pickwick,&rdquo; where his son Charles was
educated. &ldquo;Well really,&rdquo; said the prodigal father, &ldquo;he may be
said&mdash;haw&mdash;haw&mdash;to have educated himself.&rdquo; He was one of
the most rapid and accurate reporters in London when, at nineteen
years of age, in 1831, he realized his immediate ambition
and &ldquo;entered the gallery&rdquo; as parliamentary reporter to the
<i>True Sun</i>. Later he was reporter to the <i>Mirror of Parliament</i>
and then to the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>. Several of his earliest letters
are concerned with his exploits as a reporter, and allude to the
experiences he had, travelling fifteen miles an hour and being
upset in almost every description of known vehicle in various parts
of Britain between 1831 and 1836. The family was now living in
Bentwick Street, Manchester Square, but John Dickens was
still no infrequent inmate of the sponging-houses. With all the
accessories of these places of entertainment his son had grown to
be excessively familiar. Writing about 1832 to his school friend
Tom Mitton, Dickens tells him that his father has been arrested
at the suit of a wine firm, and begs him go over to Cursitor Street
and see what can be done. On another occasion of a paternal
disappearance he observes: &ldquo;I own that his absence does not
give me any great uneasiness, knowing how apt he is to get out
of the way when anything goes wrong.&rdquo; In yet another letter
he asks for a loan of four shillings.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, however, he had commenced author in a
more creative sense by penning some sketches of contemporary
London life, such as he had attempted in his school days in imitation
of the sketches published in the <i>London</i> and other magazines
of that day. The first of these appeared in the December number
of the <i>Old Monthly Magazine</i> for 1833. By the following August,
when the signature &ldquo;Boz&rdquo; was first given, five of these sketches
had appeared. By the end of 1834 we find him settled in rooms
in Furnival&rsquo;s Inn, and a little later his salary on the <i>Morning
Chronicle</i> was raised, owing to the intervention of one of its chiefs,
George Hogarth, the father of (in addition to six sons) eight
charming daughters, to one of whom, Catherine, Charles was
engaged to be married before the year was out. Clearly as his
career now seemed designated, he was at this time or a little before
it coquetting very seriously with the stage: but circumstances
were rapidly to determine another stage in his career. A year
before Queen Victoria&rsquo;s accession appeared in two volumes
<i>Sketches by Boz</i>, <i>Illustrative of Everyday Life and Everyday
People</i>. The book came from a prentice hand, but like the
little tract on the Puritan abuse of the Sabbath entitled &ldquo;Sunday
under three Heads&rdquo; which appeared a few months later, it
contains in germ all, or almost all, the future Dickens. Glance
at the headings of the pages. Here we have the Beadle and all
connected with him, London streets, theatres, shows, the pawnshop,
Doctors&rsquo; Commons, Christmas, Newgate, coaching, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>180</span>
river. Here comes a satirical picture of parliament, fun made of
cheap snobbery, a rap on the knuckles of sectarianism. And what
could be more prophetic than the title of the opening chapter&mdash;Our
Parish? With the Parish&mdash;a large one indeed&mdash;Dickens
to the end concerned himself; he began with a rapid survey of
his whole field, hinting at all he might accomplish, indicating
the limits he was not to pass. This year was to be still more
momentous to Dickens, for, on the 2nd of April 1836, he was
married to George Hogarth&rsquo;s eldest daughter Catherine. He
seems to have fallen in love with the daughters collectively,
and, judging by subsequent events, it has been suggested that
perhaps he married the wrong one. His wife&rsquo;s sister Mary was
the romance of his early married life, and another sister, Georgina,
was the dearest friend of his last ten years.</p>

<p>A few days before the marriage, just two months after the
appearance of the <i>Sketches</i>, the first part of <i>The Posthumous Papers
of the Pickwick Club</i> was announced. One of the chief vogues of
the day was the issue of humorous, sporting or anecdotal novels
in parts, with plates, and some of the best talent of the day, represented
by Ainsworth, Bulwer, Marryat, Maxwell, Egan, Hook
and Surtees, had been pressed into this kind of enterprise. The
publishers of the day had not been slow to perceive Dickens&rsquo;s
aptitude for this species of &ldquo;letterpress.&rdquo; A member of the
firm of Chapman &amp; Hall called upon him at Furnival&rsquo;s Inn in
December 1835 with a proposal that he should write about a
Nimrod Club of amateur sportsmen, foredoomed to perpetual
ignominies, while the comic illustrations were to be etched by
Seymour, a well-known rival of Cruikshank (the illustrator of
<i>Boz</i>). The offer was too tempting for Dickens to refuse, but he
changed the idea from a club of Cockney sportsmen to that of a
club of eccentric peripatetics, on the sensible grounds, first that
sporting sketches were stale, and, secondly, that he knew nothing
worth speaking of about sport. The first seven pictures appeared
with the signature of Seymour and the letterpress of Dickens.
Before the eighth picture appeared Seymour had blown his brains
out. After a brief interval of Buss, Dickens obtained the services
of Hablot K. Browne, known to all as &ldquo;Phiz.&rdquo; Author and
illustrator were as well suited to one another and to the common
creation of a unique thing as Gilbert and Sullivan. Having early
got rid of the sporting element, Dickens found himself at once.
The subject exactly suited his knowledge, his skill in arranging
incidents&mdash;nay, his very limitations too. No modern book is
so incalculable. We commence laughing heartily at Pickwick
and his troupe. The laugh becomes kindlier. We are led on
through a tangle of adventure, never dreaming what is before us.
The landscape changes: Pickwick becomes the symbol of kindheartedness,
simplicity and innocent levity. Suddenly in the Fleet
Prison a deeper note is struck. The medley of human relationships,
the loneliness, the mystery and sadness of human destinies
are fathomed. The tragedy of human life is revealed to us amid
its most farcical elements. The droll and laughable figure of the
hero is transfigured by the kindliness of human sympathy into
a beneficent and bespectacled angel in shorts and gaiters. By
defying accepted rules, Dickens had transcended the limited
sphere hitherto allotted to his art: he had produced a book to
be enshrined henceforth in the inmost hearts of all sorts and
conditions of his countrymen, and had definitely enlarged the
boundaries of English humour and English fiction. As for Mr
Pickwick, he is a fairy like Puck or Santa Claus, while his creator
is &ldquo;the last of the mythologists and perhaps the greatest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When <i>The Pickwick Papers</i> appeared in book form at the close
of 1837 Dickens&rsquo;s popular reputation was made. From the
appearance of Sam Weller in part v. the universal hunger for the
monthly parts had risen to a furore. The book was promptly
translated into French and German. The author had received
little assistance from press or critics, he had no influential connexions,
his class of subjects was such as to &ldquo;expose him at the
outset to the fatal objections of vulgarity,&rdquo; yet in less than six
months from the appearance of the first number, as the <i>Quarterly
Review</i> almost ruefully admits, the whole reading world was
talking about the Pickwickians. The names of Winkle, Wardle,
Weller, Jingle, Snodgrass, Dodson &amp; Fogg, were as familiar as
household words. Pickwick chintzes figured in the linendrapers&rsquo;
windows, and Pickwick cigars in every tobacconist&rsquo;s; Weller
corduroys became the stock-in-trade of every breeches-maker;
Boz cabs might be seen rattling through the streets, and the
portrait of the author of <i>Pelham</i> and <i>Crichton</i> was scraped down
to make way for that of the new popular favourite on the omnibuses.
A new and original genius had suddenly sprung up, there
was no denying it, even though, as the <i>Quarterly</i> concluded, &ldquo;it
required no gift of prophecy to foretell his fate&mdash;he has risen like
a rocket and he will come down like the stick.&rdquo; It would have
needed a very emphatic gift of prophecy indeed to foretell that
Dickens&rsquo;s reputation would have gone on rising until at the
present day (after one sharp fall, which reached an extreme
about 1887) it stands higher than it has ever stood before.</p>

<p>Dickens&rsquo;s assumption of the literary purple was as amazing as
anything else about him. Accepting the homage of the luminaries
of the literary, artistic and polite worlds as if it had been his
natural due, he arranges for the settlement of his family, decrees,
like another Edmund Kean, that his son is to go to Eton, carries
on the most complicated negotiations with his publishers and
editors, presides and orates with incomparable force at innumerable
banquets, public and private, arranges elaborate villegiatures
in the country, at the seaside, in France or in Italy, arbitrates in
public on every topic, political, ethical, artistic, social or literary,
entertains and legislates for an increasingly large domestic circle,
both juvenile and adult, rules himself and his time-table with
a rod of iron. In his letter-writing alone, Dickens did a life&rsquo;s
literary work. Nowadays no one thinks of writing such letters;
that is to say, letters of such length and detail, for the quality is
Dickens&rsquo;s own. He evidently enjoyed this use of the pen. Page
after page of Forster&rsquo;s <i>Life</i> (750 pages in the <i>Letters</i> edited by
his daughter and sister-in-law) is occupied with transcription from
private correspondence, and never a line of this but is thoroughly
worthy of print and preservation. If he makes a tour in any
part of the British Isles, he writes a full description of all he
sees, of everything that happens, and writes it with such gusto,
such mirth, such strokes of fine picturing, as appear in no other
private letters ever given to the public. Naturally buoyant in
all circumstances, a holiday gave him the exhilaration of a schoolboy.
See how he writes from Cornwall, when on a trip with two
or three friends, in 1843. &ldquo;Heavens! if you could have seen the
necks of bottles, distracting in their immense variety of shape,
peering out of the carriage pockets! If you could have witnessed
the deep devotion of the post-boys, the maniac glee of the waiters!
If you could have followed us into the earthy old churches we
visited, and into the strange caverns on the gloomy seashore, and
down into the depths of mines, and up to the tops of giddy heights,
where the unspeakably green water was roaring, I don&rsquo;t know
how many hundred feet below.... I never laughed in my life
as I did on this journey. It would have done you good to hear
me. I was choking and gasping and bursting the buckles off the
back of my stock, all the way. And Stanfield&rdquo;&mdash;the painter&mdash;&ldquo;got
into such apoplectic entanglements that we were obliged
to beat him on the back with portmanteaus before we could
recover him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The animation of Dickens&rsquo;s look would attract the attention
of any one, anywhere. His figure was not that of an Adonis, but
his brightness made him the centre and pivot of every society
he was in. The keenness and vivacity of his eye combined with
his inordinate appetite for life to give the unique quality to all
that he wrote. His instrument is that of the direct, sinewy
English of Smollett, combined with much of the humorous grace
of Goldsmith (his two favourite authors), but modernized to a
certain extent under the influence of Washington Irving, Sydney
Smith, Jeffrey, Lamb, and other writers of the <i>London Magazine</i>.
He taught himself to speak French and Italian, but he could have
read little in any language. His ideas were those of the inchoate
and insular liberalism of the &rsquo;thirties. His unique force in
literature he was to owe to no supreme artistic or intellectual
quality, but almost entirely to his inordinate gift of observation,
his sympathy with the humble, his power over the emotions
and his incomparable endowment of unalloyed human fun. To
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>181</span>
contemporaries he was not so much a man as an institution, at
the very mention of whose name faces were puckered with grins
or wreathed in smiles. To many his work was a revelation, the
revelation of a new world and one far better than their own.
And his influence went further than this in the direction of
revolution or revival. It gave what were then universally referred
to as &ldquo;the lower orders&rdquo; a new sense of self-respect, a new
feeling of citizenship. Like the defiance of another Luther, or the
Declaration of a new Independence, it emitted a fresh ray of hope
across the firmament. He did for the whole English-speaking
race what Burns had done for Scotland&mdash;he gave it a new
conceit of itself. He knew what a people wanted and he told
what he knew. He could do this better than anybody else
because his mind was theirs. He shared many of their &ldquo;great
useless virtues,&rdquo; among which generosity ranks before justice, and
sympathy before truth, even though, true to his middle-class vein,
he exalts piety, chastity and honesty in a manner somewhat alien
to the mind of the low-bred man. This is what makes Dickens
such a demigod and his public success such a marvel, and this
also is why any exclusively literary criticism of his work is bound
to be so inadequate. It should also help us to make the necessary
allowances for the man. Dickens, even the Dickens of legend
that we know, is far from perfect. The Dickens of reality to
which Time may furnish a nearer approximation is far less
perfect. But when we consider the corroding influence of adulation,
and the intoxication of unbridled success, we cannot but
wonder at the relatively high level of moderation and self-control
that Dickens almost invariably observed. Mr G. K. Chesterton
remarks suggestively that Dickens had all his life the faults of
the little boy who is kept up too late at night. He is overwrought
by happiness to the verge of exasperation, and yet as a matter
of fact he does keep on the right side of the breaking point. The
specific and curative in his case was the work in which he took
such anxious pride, and such unmitigated delight. He revelled
in punctual and regular work; at his desk he was often in the
highest spirits. Behold how he pictured himself, one day at
Broadstairs, where he was writing <i>Chuzzlewit</i>. &ldquo;In a bay-window
in a one-pair sits, from nine o&rsquo;clock to one, a gentleman
with rather long hair and no neckcloth, who writes and grins, as
if he thought he was very funny indeed. At one he disappears,
presently emerges from a bathing-machine, and may be seen,
a kind of salmon-colour porpoise, splashing about in the ocean.
After that, he may be viewed in another bay-window on the
ground-floor eating a strong lunch; and after that, walking a
dozen miles or so, or lying on his back on the sand reading a book.
Nobody bothers him, unless they know he is disposed to be
talked to, and I am told he is very comfortable indeed. He&rsquo;s as
brown as a berry, and they do say he is as good as a small fortune
to the innkeeper, who sells beer and cold punch.&rdquo; Here is the
secret of such work as that of Dickens; it is done with delight&mdash;done
(in a sense) easily, done with the mechanism of mind and
body in splendid order. Even so did Scott write; though more
rapidly and with less conscious care: his chapter finished before
the world had got up to breakfast. Later, Dickens produced
novels less excellent with much more of mental strain. The
effects of age could not have shown themselves so soon, but
for the unfortunate loss of energy involved in his non-literary
labours.</p>

<p>While the public were still rejoicing in the first sprightly
runnings of the &ldquo;new humour,&rdquo; the humorist set to work
desperately on the grim scenes of <i>Oliver Twist</i>, the story of a
parish orphan, the nucleus of which had already seen the light
in his <i>Sketches</i>. The early scenes are of a harrowing reality,
despite the germ of forced pathos which the observant reader may
detect in the pitiful parting between Oliver and little Dick; but
what will strike every reader at once in this book is the directness
and power of the English style, so nervous and unadorned:
from its unmistakable clearness and vigour Dickens was to travel
far as time went on. But the full effect of the old simplicity is
felt in such masterpieces of description as the drive of Oliver and
Sikes to Chertsey, the condemned-cell ecstasy of Fagin, or the
unforgettable first encounter between Oliver and the Artful
Dodger. Before November 1837 had ended, Charles Dickens
entered on an engagement to write a successor to <i>Pickwick</i> on
similar lines of publication. <i>Oliver Twist</i> was then in mid-career;
a <i>Life of Grimaldi</i> and <i>Barnaby Rudge</i> were already covenanted
for. Dickens forged ahead with the new tale of <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>
and was justified by the results, for its sale far surpassed even
that of <i>Pickwick</i>. As a conception it is one of his weakest. An
unmistakably 18th-century character pervades it. Some of the
vignettes are among the most piquant and besetting ever written.
Large parts of it are totally unobserved conventional melodrama;
but the Portsmouth Theatre and Dotheboys Hall and
Mrs Nickleby (based to some extent, it is thought, upon Miss
Bates in <i>Emma</i>, but also upon the author&rsquo;s Mamma) live for ever
as Dickens conceived them in the pages of <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>.</p>

<p>Having got rid of <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i> and resigned his editorship
of <i>Bentley&rsquo;s Miscellany</i>, in which <i>Oliver Twist</i> originally
appeared, Dickens conceived the idea of a weekly periodical to
be issued as <i>Master Humphrey&rsquo;s Clock</i>, to comprise short stories,
essays and miscellaneous papers, after the model of Addison&rsquo;s
<i>Spectator</i>. To make the weekly numbers &ldquo;go,&rdquo; he introduced
Mr Pickwick, Sam Weller and his father in friendly intercourse.
But the public requisitioned &ldquo;a story,&rdquo; and in No. 4 he had
to brace himself up to give them one. Thus was commenced
<i>The Old Curiosity Shop</i>, which was continued with slight interruptions,
and followed by <i>Barnaby Rudge</i>. For the first time
we find Dickens obsessed by a highly complicated plot. The
tonality achieved in <i>The Old Curiosity Shop</i> surpassed anything
he had attempted in this difficult vein, while the rich humour of
Dick Swiveller and the Marchioness, and the vivid portraiture
of the wandering Bohemians, attain the very highest level of
Dickensian drollery; but in the lamentable tale of Little Nell
(though Landor and Jeffrey thought the character-drawing of
this infant comparable with that of Cordelia), it is generally
admitted that he committed an indecent assault upon the
emotions by exhibiting a veritable monster of piety and long-suffering
in a child of tender years. In <i>Barnaby Rudge</i> he was
manifestly affected by the influence of Scott, whose achievements
he always regarded with a touching veneration. The plot, again,
is of the utmost complexity, and Edgar Allan Poe (who predicted
the conclusion) must be one of the few persons who ever really
mastered it. But few of Dickens&rsquo;s books are written in a more
admirable style.</p>

<p><i>Master Humphrey&rsquo;s Clock</i> concluded, Dickens started in 1842
on his first visit to America&mdash;an episode hitherto without parallel
in English literary history, for he was received everywhere with
popular acclamation as the representative of a grand triumph
of the English language and imagination, without regard to
distinctions of nationality. He offended the American public
grievously by a few words of frank description and a few
quotations of the advertisement columns of American papers
illustrating the essential barbarity of the old slave system
(<i>American Notes</i>). Dickens was soon pining for home&mdash;no English
writer is more essentially and insularly English in inspiration
and aspiration than he is. He still brooded over the perverseness
of America on the copyright question, and in his next book he
took the opportunity of uttering a few of his impressions about
the objectionable sides of American democracy, the result being
that &ldquo;all Yankee-doodle-dom blazed up like one universal soda
bottle,&rdquo; as Carlyle said. <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i> (1843-1844) is important
as closing his great character period. His <i>sève originale</i>, as the
French would say, was by this time to a considerable extent
exhausted, and he had to depend more upon artistic elaboration,
upon satires, upon <i>tours de force</i> of description, upon romantic
and ingenious contrivances. But all these resources combined
proved unequal to his powers as an original observer of popular
types, until he reinforced himself by autobiographic reminiscence,
as in <i>David Copperfield</i> and <i>Great Expectations</i>, the two great
books remaining to his later career.</p>

<p>After these two masterpieces and the three wonderful books
with which he made his début, we are inclined to rank <i>Chuzzlewit</i>.
Nothing in Dickens is more admirably seen and presented than
Todgers&rsquo;s, a bit of London particular cut out with a knife. Mr
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>182</span>
Pecksniff and Mrs Gamp, Betsy Prig and &ldquo;Mrs Harris&rdquo; have
passed into the national language and life. The coach journey,
the windy autumn night, the stealthy trail of Jonas, the undertone
of tragedy in the Charity and Mercy and Chuffey episodes
suggest a blending of imaginative vision and physical penetration
hardly seen elsewhere. Two things are specially notable about
this novel&mdash;the exceptional care taken over it (as shown by the
interlineations in the MS.) and the caprice or nonchalance of
the purchasing public, its sales being far lower than those of
any of its monthly predecessors.</p>

<p>At the close of 1843, to pay outstanding debts of his now
lavish housekeeping, he wrote that pioneer of Christmas numbers,
that national benefit as Thackeray called it, <i>A Christmas Carol</i>.
It failed to realize his pecuniary anticipations, and Dickens
resolved upon a drastic policy of retrenchment and reform.
He would save expense by living abroad and would punish his
publishers by withdrawing his custom from them, at least for a
time. Like everything else upon which he ever determined, this
resolution was carried out with the greatest possible precision and
despatch. In June 1844 he set out for Marseilles with his now
rapidly increasing family (the journey cost him £200). In a villa
on the outskirts of Genoa he wrote <i>The Chimes</i>, which, during a
brief excursion to London before Christmas, he read to a select
circle of friends (the germ of his subsequent lecture-audiences),
including Forster, Carlyle, Stanfield, Dyce, Maclise and Jerrold.
He was again in London in 1845, enjoying his favourite diversion
of private theatricals; and in January 1846 he experimented
briefly as the editor of a London morning paper&mdash;the <i>Daily
News</i>. By early spring he was back at Lausanne, writing his
customary vivid letters to his friends, craving as usual for
London streets, commencing <i>Dombey and Son</i>, and walking his
fourteen miles daily. The success of <i>Dombey and Son</i> completely
rehabilitated the master&rsquo;s finances, enabled him to return to
England, send his son to Eton and to begin to save money.
Artistically it is less satisfactory; it contains some of Dickens&rsquo;s
prime curios, such as Cuttle, Bunsby, Toots, Blimber, Pipchin,
Mrs MacStinger and young Biler; it contains also that masterpiece
of sentimentality which trembles upon the borderland
of the sublime and the ridiculous, the death of Paul Dombey
(&ldquo;that sweet Paul,&rdquo; as Jeffrey, the &ldquo;critic laureate,&rdquo; called him),
and some grievous and unquestionable blemishes. As a narrative,
moreover, it tails off into a highly complicated and exacting plot.
It was followed by a long rest at Broadstairs before Dickens
returned to the native home of his genius, and early in 1849
&ldquo;began to prepare for <i>David Copperfield</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of all my books,&rdquo; Dickens wrote, &ldquo;I like this the best; like
many fond parents I have my favourite child, and his name is
David Copperfield.&rdquo; In some respects it stands to Dickens in
something of the same relation in which the contemporary
<i>Pendennis</i> stands to Thackeray. As in that book, too, the earlier
portions are the best. They gained in intensity by the autobiographical
form into which they are thrown; as Thackeray
observed, there was no writing against such power. The tragedy
of Emily and the character of Rosa Dartle are stagey and unreal;
Uriah Heep is bad art; Agnes, again, is far less convincing
as a consolation than Dickens would have us believe; but these
are more than compensated by the wonderful realization
of early boyhood in the book, by the picture of Mr Creakle&rsquo;s
school, the Peggottys, the inimitable Mr Micawber, Betsy Trotwood
and that monument of selfish misery, Mrs Gummidge.</p>

<p>At the end of March 1850 commenced the new twopenny
weekly called <i>Household Words</i>, which Dickens planned to form
a direct means of communication between himself and his
readers, and as a means of collecting around him and encouraging
the talents of the younger generation. No one was better qualified
than he for this work, whether we consider his complete
freedom from literary jealousy or his magical gift of inspiring
young authors. Following the somewhat dreary and incoherent
<i>Bleak House</i> of 1852, <i>Hard Times</i> (1854)&mdash;an anti-Manchester
School tract, which Ruskin regarded as Dickens&rsquo;s best work&mdash;was
the first long story written for <i>Household Words</i>. About this
time Dickens made his final home at Gad&rsquo;s Hill, near Rochester,
and put the finishing touch to another long novel published upon
the old plan, <i>Little Dorrit</i> (1855-1857). In spite of the exquisite
comedy of the master of the Marshalsea and the final tragedy
of the central figure, <i>Little Dorrit</i> is sadly deficient in the old
vitality, the humour is often a mock reality, and the repetition
of comic catch-words and overstrung similes and metaphors is
such as to affect the reader with nervous irritation. The plot
and characters ruin each other in this amorphous production.
The <i>Tale of Two Cities</i>, commenced in <i>All the Year Round</i> (the
successor of <i>Household Words</i>) in 1859, is much better: the main
characters are powerful, the story genuinely tragic, and the
atmosphere lurid; but enormous labour was everywhere expended
upon the construction of stylistic ornament.</p>

<p>The <i>Tale of Two Cities</i> was followed by two finer efforts at
atmospheric delineation, the best things he ever did of this kind:
<i>Great Expectations</i> (1861), over which there broods the mournful
impression of the foggy marshes of the Lower Thames; and <i>Our
Mutual Friend</i> (1864-1865), in which the ooze and mud and
slime of Rotherhithe, its boatmen and loafers, are made to pervade
the whole book with cumulative effect. The general effect
produced by the stories is, however, very different. In the first
case, the foreground was supplied by autobiographical material
of the most vivid interest, and the lucidity of the creative impulse
impelled him to write upon this occasion with the old simplicity,
though with an added power. Nothing therefore, in the whole
range of Dickens surpassed the early chapters of <i>Great Expectations</i>
in perfection of technique or in mastery of all the resources
of the novelist&rsquo;s art. To have created Abel Magwitch alone is to
be a god indeed, says Mr Swinburne, among the creators of deathless
men. Pumblechook is actually better and droller and truer
to imaginative life than Pecksniff; Joe Gargery is worthy to have
been praised and loved at once by Fielding and by Sterne: Mr
Jaggers and his clients, Mr Wemmick and his parent and his
bride, are such figures as Shakespeare, when dropping out of
poetry, might have created, if his lot had been cast in a later
century. &ldquo;Can as much be said,&rdquo; Mr Swinburne boldly asks,
&ldquo;for the creatures of any other man or god?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In November 1867 Dickens made a second expedition to
America, leaving all the writing that he was ever to complete behind
him. He was to make a round sum of money, enough to free
him from all embarrassments, by a long series of exhausting readings,
commencing at the Tremont Temple, Boston, on the 2nd of
December. The strain of Dickens&rsquo;s ordinary life was so tense and
so continuous that it is, perhaps, rash to assume that he broke
down eventually under this particular stress; for other reasons,
however, his persistence in these readings, subsequent to his
return, was strongly deprecated by his literary friends, led by
the arbitrary and relentless Forster. It is a long testimony to
Dickens&rsquo;s self-restraint, even in his most capricious and despotic
moments, that he never broke the cord of obligation which bound
him to his literary mentor, though sparring matches between them
were latterly of frequent occurrence. His farewell reading was
given on the 15th of March 1870, at St James&rsquo;s Hall. He then
vanished from &ldquo;those garish lights,&rdquo; as he called them, &ldquo;for
evermore.&rdquo; Of the three brief months that remained to him,
his last book, <i>The Mystery of Edwin Drood</i>, was the chief occupation.
It hardly promised to become a masterpiece (Longfellow&rsquo;s
opinion) as did Thackeray&rsquo;s <i>Denis Duval</i>, but contained much fine
descriptive technique, grouped round a scene of which Dickens
had an unrivalled sympathetic knowledge.</p>

<p>In March and April 1870 Dickens, as was his wont, was mixing
in the best society; he dined with the prince at Lord Houghton&rsquo;s
and was twice at court, once at a long deferred private interview
with the queen, who had given him a presentation copy of her
<i>Leaves from a Journal of our Life in the Highlands</i> with the
inscription &ldquo;From one of the humblest of authors to one of the
greatest&rdquo;; and who now begged him on his persistent refusal
of any other title to accept the nominal distinction of a privy
councillor. He took for four months the Milner Gibsons&rsquo; house
at 5 Hyde Park Place, opposite the Marble Arch, where he gave
a brilliant reception on the 7th of April. His last public appearance
was made at the Royal Academy banquet early in May.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>183</span>
He returned to his regular methodical routine of work at Gad&rsquo;s
Hill on the 30th of May, and one of the last instalments he wrote
of <i>Edwin Drood</i> contained an ominous speculation as to the next
two people to die at Cloisterham: &ldquo;Curious to make a guess at
the two, or say at one of the two.&rdquo; Two letters bearing the well-known
superscription &ldquo;Gad&rsquo;s Hill Place, Higham by Rochester,
Kent&rdquo; are dated the 8th of June, and, on the same Thursday, after
a long spell of writing in the Châlet where he habitually wrote,
he collapsed suddenly at dinner. Startled by the sudden change
in the colour and expression of his face, his sister-in-law (Miss
Hogarth) asked him if he was ill; he said &ldquo;Yes, very ill,&rdquo; but
added that he would finish dinner and go on afterwards to London.
&ldquo;Come and lie down,&rdquo; she entreated; &ldquo;Yes, on the ground,&rdquo;
he said, very distinctly; these were the last words he spoke, and
he slid from her arms and fell upon the floor. He died at 6-10 P.M.
on Friday, the 9th of June, and was buried privately in Poets&rsquo;
Corner, Westminster Abbey, in the early morning of the 14th of
June. One of the most appealing memorials was the drawing
by his &ldquo;new illustrator&rdquo; Luke Fildes in the <i>Graphic</i> of &ldquo;The
Empty Chair; Gad&rsquo;s Hill: ninth of June, 1870.&rdquo; &ldquo;Statesmen,
men of science, philanthropists, the acknowledged benefactors of
their race, might pass away, and yet not leave the void which will
be caused by the death of Charles Dickens&rdquo; (<i>The Times</i>). In
his will he enjoined his friends to erect no monument in his
honour, and directed his name and dates only to be inscribed on
his tomb, adding this proud provision, &ldquo;I rest my claim to
the remembrance of my country on my published works.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dickens had no artistic ideals worth speaking about. The
sympathy of his readers was the one thing he cared about and,
like Cobbett, he went straight for it through the avenue of the
emotions. In personality, intensity and range of creative genius
he can hardly be said to have any modern rival. His creations
live, move and have their being about us constantly, like those
of Homer, Virgil, Chaucer, Rabelais, Cervantes, Shakespeare,
Bunyan, Molière and Sir Walter Scott. As to the books themselves,
the backgrounds on which these mighty figures are projected,
they are manifestly too vast, too chaotic and too unequal
ever to become classics. Like most of the novels constructed upon
the unreformed model of Smollett and Fielding, those of Dickens
are enormous stock-pots into which the author casts every kind
of autobiographical experience, emotion, pleasantry, anecdote,
adage or apophthegm. The fusion is necessarily very incomplete
and the hotch-potch is bound to fall to pieces with time.
Dickens&rsquo;s plots, it must be admitted, are strangely unintelligible,
the repetitions and stylistic decorations of his work exceed
all bounds, the form is unmanageable and insignificant. The
diffuseness of the English novel, in short, and its extravagant
didacticism cannot fail to be most prejudicial to its perpetuation.
In these circumstances there is very little fiction that will stand
concentration and condensation so well as that of Dickens.</p>

<p>For these reasons among others our interest in Dickens&rsquo;s novels
as integers has diminished and is diminishing. But, on the other
hand, our interest and pride in him as a man and as a representative
author of his age and nation has been steadily augmented
and is still mounting. Much of the old criticism of his work, that
it was not up to a sufficiently high level of art, scholarship or
gentility, that as an author he is given to caricature, redundancy
and a shameless subservience to popular caprice, must now be
discarded as irrelevant.</p>

<p>As regards formal excellence it is plain that Dickens labours
under the double disadvantage of writing in the least disciplined
of all literary genres in the most lawless literary milieu of the
modern world, that of Victorian England. In spite of these
defects, which are those of masters such as Rabelais, Hugo and
Tolstoy, the work of Dickens is more and more instinctively felt
to be true, original and ennobling. It is already beginning to
undergo a process of automatic sifting, segregation and crystallization,
at the conclusion of which it will probably occupy a larger
segment in the literary consciousness of the English-spoken race
than ever before.</p>

<p>Portraits of Dickens, from the gay and alert &ldquo;Boz&rdquo; of Samuel
Lawrence, and the self-conscious, rather foppish portrait by
Maclise which served as frontispiece to <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>, to
the sketch of him as Bobadil by C. R. Leslie, the Drummond and
Ary Scheffer portraits of middle age and the haggard and drawn
representations of him from photographs after his shattering
experiences as a public entertainer from 1856 (the year of his
separation from his wife) onwards, are reproduced in Kitton, in
Forster and Gissing and in the other biographies. Sketches are
also given in most of the books of his successive dwelling places
at Ordnance Terrace and 18 St Mary&rsquo;s Place, Chatham; Bayham
Street, Camden Town; 15 Furnival&rsquo;s Inn; 48 Doughty Street;
1 Devonshire Terrace, Regent&rsquo;s Park; Tavistock House,
Tavistock Square; and Gad&rsquo;s Hill Place. The manuscripts of all
the novels, with the exception of the <i>Tale of Two Cities</i> and
<i>Edwin Drood</i>, were given to Forster, and are now preserved in the
Dyce and Forster Museum at South Kensington. The work of
Dickens was a prize for which publishers naturally contended both
before and after his death. The first collective edition of his
works was begun in April 1847, and their number is now very
great. The most complete is still that of Messrs Chapman &amp;
Hall, the original publishers of <i>Pickwick</i>; others of special
interest are the Harrap edition, originally edited by F. G. Kitton;
Macmillan&rsquo;s edition with original illustrations and introduction
by Charles Dickens the younger; and the edition in the World&rsquo;s
Classics with introductions by G.K. Chesterton. Of the translations
the best known is that done into French by Lorain, Pichot
and others, with B.H. Gausseron&rsquo;s excellent <i>Pages Choisies</i> (1903).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Bibliography.</span>&mdash;During his lifetime Dickens&rsquo;s biographer was
clearly indicated in his guide, philosopher and friend, John Forster,
who had known the novelist intimately since the days of his first
triumph with <i>Pickwick</i>, who had constituted himself a veritable
encyclopaedia of information about Dickens, and had clung to his
subject (in spite of many rebuffs which his peremptory temper found
it hard to digest) as tightly as ever Boswell had enveloped Johnson.
Two volumes of Forster&rsquo;s <i>Life of Charles Dickens</i> appeared in 1872
and a third in 1874. He relied much on Dickens&rsquo;s letters to himself
and produced what must always remain the authoritative work.
The first two volumes are put together with much art, the portrait
as a whole has been regarded as truthful, and the immediate success
was extraordinary. In the opinion of Carlyle, Forster&rsquo;s book was not
unworthy to be named after that of Boswell. A useful abridgment
was carried out in 1903 by the novelist George Gissing. Gissing also
wrote <i>Charles Dickens: A Critical Study</i> (1898), which ranks with
G.K. Chesterton&rsquo;s <i>Charles Dickens</i>(1906) as a commentary inspired by
deep insight and adorned by great literary talent upon the genius of
the master-novelist. The names of other lives, sketches, articles and
estimates of Dickens and his works would occupy a large volume in
the mere enumeration. See R.H. Shepherd, <i>The Bibliography of
Dickens</i> (1880); <i>James Cooke&rsquo;s Bibliography of the Writings of Charles
Dickens</i> (1879); <i>Dickensiana</i>, by F. G. Kitton (1886); and <i>Bibliography</i>
by J.P. Anderson, appended to Sir F.T. Marzials&rsquo;s <i>Life of
Charles Dickens</i> (1887). Among the earlier sketches may be specially
cited the lives by J. C. Hotten and G. A. Sala (1870), the Anecdote-Biography
edited by the American R. H. Stoddard (1874), Dr A. W.
Ward in the English Men of Letters Series (1878), that by Sir Leslie
Stephen in the <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>, and that by Professor
Minto in the eighth edition of the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>.
The <i>Letters</i> were first issued in two volumes edited by his daughter
and sister-in-law in 1880. For Dickens&rsquo;s connexion with Kent the
following books are specially valuable:&mdash;Robert Langton&rsquo;s <i>Childhood
and Youth of Charles Dickens</i> (1883); Langton&rsquo;s <i>Dickens and
Rochester</i> (1880); Thomas Frost&rsquo;s <i>In Kent with Charles Dickens</i>
(1880); F. G. Kitton&rsquo;s <i>The Dickens Country</i> (1905); H. S. Ward&rsquo;s
<i>The Real Dickens Land</i> (1904); R. Allbut&rsquo;s <i>Rambles in Dickens Land</i>
(1899 and 1903). For Dickens&rsquo;s reading tours see G. Dolby&rsquo;s
<i>Charles Dickens as I knew him</i> (1884); J. T. Fields&rsquo;s <i>In and Out of
Doors with Charles Dickens</i> (1876); Charles Kent&rsquo;s <i>Dickens as a
Reader</i> (1872). And for other aspects of his life see M. Dickens&rsquo;s <i>My
Father as I recall him</i> (1897); P. H. Fitzgerald&rsquo;s <i>Life of C. Dickens as
revealed in his Writings</i> (1905), and <i>Bozland</i> (1895); F. G. Kitton&rsquo;s
<i>Charles Dickens, his Life, Writings and Personality</i>, a useful compendium
(1902); T. E. Pemberton&rsquo;s <i>Charles Dickens and the Stage</i>, and
<i>Dickens&rsquo;s London</i> (1876); F. Miltoun&rsquo;s <i>Dickens&rsquo;s London</i> (1904);
Kitton&rsquo;s <i>Dickens and his Illustrators</i>; W. Teignmouth Shore&rsquo;s <i>Charles
Dickens and his Friends</i> (1904 and 1909); B. W. Matz, <i>Story of
Dickens&rsquo;s Life and Work</i> (1904), and review of solutions to <i>Edwin
Drood</i> in <i>The Bookman</i> for March 1908; the recollections of Edmund
Yates, Trollope, James Payn, Lehmann, R. H. Horne, Lockwood
and many others. <i>The Dickensian</i>, a magazine devoted to Dickensian
subjects, was started in 1905; it is the organ of the Dickens Fellowship,
and in a sense of the Boz Club. <i>A Dickens Dictionary</i> (by G. A.
Pierce) appeared in 1872 and 1878; another (by A. J. Philip) in 1909;
and a <i>Dickens Concordance</i> by Mary Williams in 1907.</p>

author and lecturer, was born, of Quaker parentage, at
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on the 28th of October 1842. She
was educated at the Friends&rsquo; Free School in Philadelphia, and
was for a time a teacher. In 1861 she obtained a clerkship in the
United States mint, but was removed for criticizing General
McClellan at a public meeting. She had gradually become
widely known as an eloquent and persuasive public speaker, one
of the first of her sex to mount the platform to discuss the burning
questions of the hour. Before the Civil War she lectured on
anti-slavery topics, during the war she toured the country on behalf
of the Sanitary Commission, and also lectured on reconstruction,
temperance and woman&rsquo;s rights. She wrote several plays, including
<i>The Crown of Thorns</i> (1876); <i>Mary Tudor</i> (1878), in which
she appeared in the title rôle; <i>Aurelian</i> (1878); and <i>An American
Girl</i> (1880), successfully acted by Fanny Davenport. She also
published a novel, <i>Which Answer?</i> (1868); <i>A Paying Investment,
a Plea for Education</i> (1876); and <i>A Ragged Register of People,
Places and Opinions</i> (1879).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DICKINSON, JOHN<a name="ar39" id="ar39"></a></span> (1732-1808), American statesman and
pamphleteer, was born in Talbot county, Maryland, on the 8th
of November 1732. He removed with his father to Kent county,
Delaware, in 1740, studied under private tutors, read law, and in
1753 entered the Middle Temple, London. Returning to America
in 1757, he began the practice of law in Philadelphia, was speaker
of the Delaware assembly in 1760, and was a member of the
Pennsylvania assembly in 1762-1765 and again in 1770-1776.<a name="fa1c" id="fa1c" href="#ft1c"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
He represented Pennsylvania in the Stamp Act Congress (1765)
and in the Continental Congress from 1774 to 1776, when he
was defeated owing to his opposition to the Declaration of
Independence. He then retired to Delaware, served for a time
as private and later as brigader-general in the state militia, and
was again a member of the Continental Congress (from Delaware)
in 1779-1780. He was president of the executive council, or chief
executive officer, of Delaware in 1781-1782, and of Pennsylvania
in 1782-1785, and was a delegate from Delaware to the Annapolis
convention of 1786 and the Federal Constitutional convention
of 1787. Dickinson has aptly been called the &ldquo;Penman of the
Revolution.&rdquo; No other writer of the day presented arguments so
numerous, so timely and so popular. He drafted the &ldquo;Declaration
of Rights&rdquo; of the Stamp Act Congress, the &ldquo;Petition to the
King&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Address to the Inhabitants of Quebec&rdquo; of the
Congress of 1774, and the second &ldquo;Petition to the King&rdquo;<a name="fa2c" id="fa2c" href="#ft2c"><span class="sp">2</span></a> and
the &ldquo;Articles of Confederation&rdquo; of the second Congress. Most
influential of all, however, were <i>The Letters of a Farmer in
Pennsylvania</i>, written in 1767-1768 in condemnation of the
Townshend Acts of 1767, in which he rejected speculative
natural rights theories and appealed to the common sense of
the people through simple legal arguments. By opposing the
Declaration of Independence, he lost his popularity and was never
able entirely to regain it. As the representative of a small state,
he championed the principle of state equality in the constitutional
convention, but was one of the first to advocate the
compromise, which was finally adopted, providing for equal
representation, in one house and proportional representation in
the other. He was probably influenced by Delaware prejudice
against Pennsylvania when he drafted the clause which forbids
the creation of a new state by the junction of two or more states
or parts of states without the consent of the states concerned as
well as of congress. After the adjournment of the convention he
defended its work in a series of letters signed &ldquo;Fabius,&rdquo; which
will bear comparison with the best of the Federalist productions.
It was largely through his influence that Delaware and
Pennsylvania were the first two states to ratify the Constitution.
Dickinson&rsquo;s interests were not exclusively political. He helped
to found Dickinson College (named in his honour) at Carlisle,
Pennsylvania, in 1783, was the first president of its board of
trustees, and was for many years its chief benefactor. He died
on the 14th of February 1808 and was buried in the Friends&rsquo;
burial ground in Wilmington, Del.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DICKSON, SIR ALEXANDER<a name="ar40" id="ar40"></a></span> (1777-1840), British artillerist,
entered the Royal Military Academy in 1793, passing out as
second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery in the following year.
As a subaltern he saw service in Minorca in 1798 and at Malta in
1800. As a captain he took part in the unfortunate Montevideo
Expedition of 1806-07, and in 1809 he accompanied Howorth
to the Peninsular War as brigade-major of the artillery. He soon
obtained a command in the Portuguese artillery, and as a
lieutenant-colonel of the Portuguese service took part in the
various battles of 1810-11. At the two sieges of Budazoz,
Ciudad Rodrigo, the Salamanca forts and Burgos, he was
entrusted by Wellington (who had the highest opinion of him)
with most of the detailed artillery work, and at Salamanca battle
he commanded the reserve artillery. In the end he became
commander of the whole of the artillery of the allied army, and
though still only a substantive captain in the British service he
had under his orders some 8000 men. At Vitoria, the Pyrenees
battles and Toulouse he directed the movements of the artillery
engaged, and at the end of the war received handsome presents
from the officers who had served under him, many of whom were
his seniors in the army list. He was at the disastrous affair of
New Orleans, but returned to Europe in time for the Waterloo
campaign. He was present at Quatre Bras and Waterloo on the
artillery staff of Wellington&rsquo;s army, and subsequently commanded
the British battering train at the sieges of the French fortresses
left behind the advancing allies. For the rest of his life he was on
home service, principally as a staff officer of artillery. He died,
a major-general and G.C.B., in 1840. A memorial was erected at
Woolwich in 1847. Dickson was one of the earliest fellows of the
Royal Geographical Society.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DICKSON, SIR JAMES ROBERT<a name="ar41" id="ar41"></a></span> (1832-1901), Australian
statesman, was born in Plymouth on the 30th of November 1832.
He was brought up in Glasgow, receiving his education at the
high school, and became a clerk in the City of Glasgow Bank.
In 1854 he emigrated to Victoria, but after some years spent
in that colony and in New South Wales, he settled in 1862 in
Queensland, where he was connected with many important
business enterprises, among them the Royal Bank of Queensland.
He entered the Queensland House of Assembly in 1872, and
became minister of works (1876), treasurer (1876-1879, and 1883-1887),
acting premier (1884), but resigned in 1887 on the question
of taxing land. In 1889 he retired from business, and spent three
years in Europe before resuming political life. He fought for
the introduction of Polynesian labour on the Queensland sugar
plantations at the general election of 1892, and was elected to the
House of Assembly in that year and again at the elections of 1893
and 1896. He became secretary for railways in 1897, minister for
home affairs in 1898, represented Queensland in the federal
council of Australia in 1896 and at the postal conference at
Hobart in 1898, and in 1898 became premier. His energies were
now devoted to the formation of an Australian commonwealth.
He secured the reference of the question to a plebiscite, the result
of which justified his anticipations. He resigned the premiership
in November 1899, but in the ministry of Robert Philp, formed
in the next month, he was reappointed to the offices of chief
secretary and vice-president of the executive council which he had
combined with the office of premier. He represented Queensland
in 1900 at the conference held in London to consider the question
of Australian unity, and on his return was appointed minister of
defence in the first government of the Australian Commonwealth.
He did not long survive the accomplishment of his political aims,
dying at Sydney on the 10th of January 1901, in the midst of
the festivities attending the inauguration of the new state.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DICOTYLEDONS,<a name="ar42" id="ar42"></a></span> in botany, the larger of the two great classes
of angiosperms, embracing most of the common flower-bearing
plants. The name expresses the most universal character of the
class, the importance of which was first noticed by John Ray,
namely, the presence of a pair of seed-leaves or cotyledons, in
the plantlet or embryo contained in the seed. The embryo is
generally surrounded by a larger or smaller amount of foodstuff
(endosperm) which serves to nourish it in its development to
form a seedling when the seed germinates; frequently, however,
as in pea or bean and their allies, the whole of the nourishment for
future use is stored up in the cotyledons themselves, which then
become thick and fleshy. In germination of the seed the root of
the embryo (radicle) grows out to get a holdfast for the plant;
this is generally followed by the growth of the short stem
immediately above the root, the so-called &ldquo;hypocotyl,&rdquo; which
carries up the cotyledons above the ground, where they spread
to the light and become the first green leaves of the plant.
Protected between the cotyledons and terminating the axis of the
plant is the first stem-bud (the plumule of the embryo), by the
further growth and development of which the aerial portion of
the plant, consisting of stem, leaves and branches, is formed,
while the development of the radicle forms the root-system.
The size and manner of growth of the adult plant show a great
variety, from the small herb lasting for one season only, to the
forest tree living for centuries. The arrangement of the conducting
tissue in the stem is characteristic; a transverse section of
the very young stem shows a <span class="correction" title="amended from nunber">number</span> of distinct conducting
strands&mdash;vascular bundles&mdash;arranged in a ring round the pith;
these soon become united to form a closed ring of bast and
wood, separated by a layer of formative tissue (cambium). In
perennials the stem shows a regular increase in thickness each
year by the addition of a new ring of wood outside the old one&mdash;for
details of structure see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Plants</a></span>: <i>Anatomy</i>. A similar growth
occurs in the root. This increase in the diameter of stem and root
is correlated with the increase in leaf-area each season, due to the
continued production of new leaf-bearing branches. A characteristic
of the class is afforded by the complicated network formed
by the leaf-veins,&mdash;well seen in a skeleton leaf, from which the soft
parts have been removed by maceration. The parts of the
flower are most frequently arranged in fives, or multiples of fives;
for instance, a common arrangement is as follows,&mdash;five sepals,
succeeded by five petals, ten stamens in two sets of five, and five
or fewer carpels; an arrangement in fours is less frequent, while
the arrangement in threes, so common in monocotyledons, is rare
in dicotyledons. In some orders the parts are numerous, chiefly
in the case of the stamens and the carpels, as in the buttercup and
other members of the order Ranunculaceae. There is a very wide
range in the general structure and arrangement of the parts of the
flower, associated with the means for ensuring the transference of
pollen; in the simplest cases the flower consists only of a few
stamens or carpels, with no enveloping sepals or petals, as in the
willow, while in the more elaborate type each series is represented,
the whole forming a complicated structure closely correlated
with the size, form and habits of the pollinating agent (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Flower</a></span>). The characters of the fruit and seed and the means
for ensuring the dispersal of the seeds are also very varied (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Fruit</a></span>).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DICTATOR<a name="ar43" id="ar43"></a></span> (from the Lat. <i>dictare</i>, frequentative of <i>dicere</i>, to
speak). In modern usage this term is loosely used for a personal
ruler enjoying extraordinary and extra-constitutional power.
The etymological sense of one who &ldquo;dictates&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> one whose
word (<i>dictum</i>) is law (from which that of one who &ldquo;dictates,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>
speaks for some writer to record, is to be distinguished)&mdash;has
been assisted by the historical use of the term, in ancient times,
for an extraordinary magistrate in the Roman commonwealth.
It is unknown precisely how the Roman word came into use,
though an explanation of the earlier official title, magister populi,
throws some light on the subject. That designation may mean
&ldquo;head of the (infantry) host&rdquo; as opposed to his subordinate, the
magister equitum, who was &ldquo;head of the cavalry.&rdquo; If this explanation
be accepted, emphasis was thus laid in early times on the
military aspect of the dictatorship, and in fact the office seems to
have been instituted for the purpose of meeting a military crisis
such as might have proved too serious for the annual consuls with
their divided command. Later constitutional theory held that
the repression of civil discord was also one of the motives for the
institution of a dictatorship. Such is the view expressed by
Cicero in the <i>De legibus</i> (iii. 3, 9) and by the emperor Claudius
in his extant <i>Oratio</i> (i. 28). This function of the office, although
it may not have been contemplated at first, is attested by
the internal history of Rome. In the crisis of the agitation that
gathered round the Licinian laws (367 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>) a dictator was appointed,
and in 314 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> we have the notice of a dictator created
for purposes of criminal jurisdiction (<i>quaestionibus exercendis</i>).
The dictator appointed to meet the dangers of war, sedition or
crime was technically described as &ldquo;the administrative dictator&rdquo;
(<i>rei gerundae causa</i>). Minor, or merely formal, needs of the state
might lead to the creation of other types of this office. Thus we
find dictators destined to hold the elections, to make out the list
of the senate, to celebrate games, to establish festivals, and to
drive the nail into the temple of Jupiter&mdash;an act of natural
magic which was believed to avert pestilence. These dictators
appointed for minor purposes were expected to retire from office
as soon as their function was completed. The &ldquo;administrative
dictator&rdquo; held office for at least six months.</p>

<p>The powers of a dictator were a temporary revival of those
of the kings; but there were some limitations to his authority.
He was never concerned with civil jurisdiction, and was
dependent on the senate for supplies of money. His military
authority was confined to Italy; and his power of life and death
over the citizens was at an early period limited by law. It was
probably the <i>lex Valeria</i> of 300 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> that made him subject to the
right of criminal appeal (<i>provocatio</i>) within the limits of the city.
But during his tenure of power all the magistrates of the people
were regarded as his subordinates; and it was even held that
the right of assistance (<i>auxilium</i>), furnished by the tribunes of the
plebs to members of the citizen body, should not be effectively
exercised when the state was under this type of martial law. The
dictator was nominated by one of the consuls. But here as elsewhere
the senate asserted its authority over the magistrates, and
the view was finally held that the senate should not only suggest
the need of nomination but also the name of the nominee. After
the nomination, the imperium of the dictator was confirmed by
a <i>lex curiata</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Comitia</a></span>). To emphasize the superiority of this
imperium over that of the consuls, the dictator might be preceded
by twenty-four lictors, not by the usual twelve; and, at least in
the earlier period of the office, these lictors bore the axes, the
symbols of life and death, within the city walls.</p>

<p>Tradition represents the dictatorship as having a life of three
centuries in the history of the Roman state. The first dictator
is said to have been created in 501 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>; the last of the
&ldquo;administrative&rdquo; dictators belongs to the year 216 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> It was
an office that was incompatible both with the growing spirit of
constitutionalism and with the greater security of the city; and
the epoch of the Second Punic War was marked by experiments
with the office, such as the election of Q. Fabius Maximus by the
people, and the co-dictatorship of M. Minucius with Fabius, which
heralded its disuse (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Punic Wars</a></span>). The emergency office of
the early and middle Republic has few points of contact, except
those of the extraordinary position and almost unfettered
authority of its holder, with the dictatorship as revised by Sulla
and by Caesar. Sulla&rsquo;s dictatorship was the form taken by a
provisional government. He was created &ldquo;for the establishment
of the Republic.&rdquo; It is less certain whether the dictatorships held
by Caesar were of a consciously provisional character. Since the
office represented the only supreme <i>Imperium</i> in Rome, it was
the natural resort of the founder of a monarchy (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sulla</a></span> and
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Caesar</a></span>). Ostensibly to prevent its further use for such a purpose,
M. Antonius in 44 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> carried a law abolishing the dictatorship as
a part of the constitution.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DICTIONARY.<a name="ar44" id="ar44"></a></span> In its proper and most usual meaning a
dictionary is a book containing a collection of the words of a
language, dialect or subject, arranged alphabetically or
in some other definite order, and with explanations in the
<span class="sidenote">Definition and history.</span>
same or some other language. When the words are few in
number, being only a small part of those belonging to
the subject, or when they are given without explanation, or some
only are explained, or the explanations are partial, the work is
called a <i>vocabulary</i>; and when there is merely a list of explanations
of the technical words and expressions in some particular
subject, a <i>glossary</i>. An alphabetical arrangement of the words
of some book or author with references to the places where
they occur is called an index (<i>q.v.</i>). When under each word
the phrases containing it are added to the references, the work is
called a <i>concordance</i>. Sometimes, however, these names are given
to true dictionaries; thus the great Italian dictionary of the
<i>Accademia della Crusca</i>, in six volumes folio, is called <i>Vocabolario</i>,
and Ernesti&rsquo;s dictionary to Cicero is called <i>Index</i>. When the
words are arranged according to a definite system of classification
under heads and subdivisions, according to their nature or their
meaning, the book is usually called a classed vocabulary; but
when sufficient explanations are given it is often accepted as a
dictionary, like the <i>Onomasticon</i> of Julius Pollux, or the native
dictionaries of Sanskrit, Manchu and many other languages.</p>

<p>Dictionaries were originally books of reference explaining the
words of a language or of some part of it. As the names of
things, as well as those of persons and places, are words, and
often require explanation even more than other classes of words,
they were necessarily included in dictionaries, and often to a very
great extent. In time, books were devoted to them alone, and
were limited to special subjects, and these have so multiplied,
that dictionaries of things now rival in number and variety those
of words or of languages, while they often far surpass them in bulk.
There are dictionaries of biography and history, real and fictitious,
general and special, relating to men of all countries, characters
and professions; the English <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Biography</a></span>) is a great instance of one form of these;
dictionaries of bibliography, relating to all books, or to those
of some particular kind or country; dictionaries of geography
(sometimes called <i>gazetteers</i>) of the whole world, of particular
countries, or of small districts, of towns and of villages, of
castles, monasteries and other buildings. There are dictionaries
of philosophy; of the Bible; of mathematics; of natural history,
zoology, botany; of birds, trees, plants and flowers; of
chemistry, geology and mineralogy; of architecture, painting
and music; of medicine, surgery, anatomy, pathology and
physiology; of diplomacy; of law, canon, civil, statutory and
criminal; of political and social sciences; of agriculture, rural
economy and gardening; of commerce, navigation, horsemanship
and the military arts; of mechanics, machines and
the manual arts. There are dictionaries of antiquities, of
chronology, of dates, of genealogy, of heraldry, of diplomatics, of
abbreviations, of useful receipts, of monograms, of adulterations
and of very many other subjects. These works are separately
referred to in the bibliographies attached to the articles on the
separate subjects. And lastly, there are dictionaries of the arts
and sciences, and their comprehensive offspring, encyclopaedias
(<i>q.v.</i>), which include in themselves every branch of knowledge.
Neither under the heading of <i>dictionary</i> nor under that of
<i>encyclopaedia</i> do we propose to include a mention of every work
of its class, but many of these will be referred to in the separate
articles on the subjects to which they pertain. And in this
article we confine ourselves to an account of those dictionaries
which are primarily word-books. This is practically the most
convenient distinction from the subject-book or encyclopaedia;
though the two characters are often combined in one work. Thus
the <i>Century Dictionary</i> has encyclopaedic features, while the
present edition of the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>, restoring its
earlier tradition but carrying out the idea more systematically,
also embodies dictionary features.</p>

<p><i>Dictionarium</i> is a word of low or modern Latinity;<a name="fa1d" id="fa1d" href="#ft1d"><span class="sp">1</span></a> <i>dictio</i>,
from which it was formed, was used in medieval Latin to mean
a word. <i>Lexicon</i> is a corresponding word of Greek origin,
meaning a book of or for words&mdash;a dictionary. A <i>glossary</i> is
properly a collection of unusual or foreign words requiring
explanation. It is the name frequently given to English
dictionaries of dialects, which the Germans usually call <i>idioticon</i>,
and the Italians <i>vocabolario</i>. <i>Wörterbuch</i>, a book of words, was
first used among the Germans, according to Grimm, by Kramer
(1719), imitated from the Dutch <i>woordenboek</i>. From the Germans
the Swedes and Danes adopted <i>ordbok</i>, <i>ordbog</i>. The Icelandic
<i>ordabôk</i>, like the German, contains the genitive plural. The
Slavonic nations use <i>slovar</i>, <i>slovnik</i>, and the southern Slavs
<i>ryetshnik</i>, from <i>slovo</i>, <i>ryetsh</i>, a word, formed, like dictionary
and lexicon, without composition. Many other names have been
given to dictionaries, as <i>thesaurus</i>, <i>Sprachschatz</i>, <i>cornucopia</i>,
<i>gazophylacium</i>, <i>comprehensorium</i>, <i>catholicon</i>, to indicate their
completeness; <i>manipulus predicantium</i>, <i>promptorium puerorum</i>,
<i>liber memorialis</i>, <i>hortus vocabulorum</i>, <i>ionia</i> (a violet bed), <i>alveary</i>
(a beehive), <i>kamoos</i> (the sea), <i>haft kulzum</i> (the seven seas), <i>tsze
tien</i> (a standard of character), <i>onomasticon</i>, <i>nomenclator</i>, <i>bibliotheca</i>,
<i>elucidario</i>, <i>Mundart-sammlung</i>, <i>clavis</i>, <i>scala</i>, <i>pharetra</i>,<a name="fa2d" id="fa2d" href="#ft2d"><span class="sp">2</span></a> <i>La
Crusca</i> from the great Italian dictionary, and <i>Calepino</i> (in Spanish
and Italian) from the Latin dictionary of Calepinus.</p>

<p>The tendency of great dictionaries is to unite in themselves all
the peculiar features of special dictionaries. A large dictionary
is most useful when a word is to be thoroughly studied, or when
there is difficulty in making out the meaning of a word or phrase.
Special dictionaries are more useful for special purposes; for
instance, synonyms are best studied in a dictionary of synonyms.
And small dictionaries are more convenient for frequent use, as
in translating from an unfamiliar language, for words may be
found more quickly, and they present the words and their
meanings in a concentrated and compact form, instead of being
scattered over a large space, and separated by other matter.
Dictionaries of several languages, called <i>polyglots</i>, are of different
kinds. Some are polyglot in the vocabulary, but not in the
explanation, like Johnson&rsquo;s dictionary of Persian and Arabic
explained in English; some in the interpretation, but not in the
vocabulary or explanation, like <i>Calepini octoglotton</i>, a Latin
dictionary of Latin, with the meanings in seven languages.
Many great dictionaries are now polyglot in this sense. Some are
polyglot in the vocabulary and interpretation, but are explained
in one language, like Jal&rsquo;s <i>Glossaire nautique</i>, a glossary of sea
terms in many languages, giving the equivalents of each word in
the other languages, but the explanation in French. Pauthier&rsquo;s
<i>Annamese Dictionary</i> is polyglot in a peculiar way. It gives
the Chinese characters with their pronunciation in Chinese and
Annamese. Special dictionaries are of many kinds. There are
technical dictionaries of etymology, foreign words, dialects,
secret languages, slang, neology, barbarous words, faults of expression,
choice words, prosody, pronunciation, spelling, orators,
poets, law, music, proper names, particular authors, nouns, verbs,
participles, particles, double forms, difficulties and many others.
Fick&rsquo;s dictionary (Göttingen, 1868, 8vo; 1874-1876, 8vo, 4 vols.)
is a remarkable attempt to ascertain the common language of
the Indo-European nations before each of their great separations.
In the second edition of his <i>Etymologische Forschungen</i> (Lemgo
and Detmoldt, 1859-1873, 8vo, 7217 pages) Pott gives a
comparative lexicon of Indo-European roots, 2226 in number,
occupying 5140 pages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>187</span></p>

<p>At no time was progress in the making of general dictionaries
so rapid as during the second half of the 19th century. It is to
be seen in three things: in the perfecting of the theory of what
a general dictionary should be; in the elaboration
<span class="sidenote">Methods.</span>
of methods of collecting and editing lexicographic
materials; and in the magnitude and improved quality of the
work which has been accomplished or planned. Each of these
can best be illustrated from English lexicography, in which the
process of development has in all directions been carried farthest.
The advance that has been made in theory began with a radical
change of opinion with regard to the chief end of the general
dictionary of a language. The older view of the matter was that
the lexicographer should furnish a standard of usage&mdash;should
register only those words which are, or at some period of the
language have been, &ldquo;good&rdquo; from a literary point of view, with
their &ldquo;proper&rdquo; senses and uses, or should at least furnish the
means of determining what these are. In other words, his chief
duty was conceived to be to sift and refine, to decide authoritatively
questions with regard to good usage, and thus to fix the
language as completely as might be possible within the limits
determined by the literary taste of his time. Thus the Accademia
della Crusca, founded near the close of the 16th century, was
established for the purpose of purifying in this way the Italian
tongue, and in 1612 the <i>Vocabolario degli Accademici della
Crusca</i>, long the standard of that language, was published. The
Académie Française, the first edition of whose dictionary
appeared in 1694, had a similar origin. In England the idea of
constructing a dictionary upon this principle arose during the
second quarter of the 18th century. It was imagined by men of
letters&mdash;among them Alexander Pope&mdash;that the English language
had then attained such perfection that further improvement was
hardly possible, and it was feared that if it were not fixed by
lexicographic authority deterioration would soon begin. Since
there was no English &ldquo;Academy,&rdquo; it was necessary that the task
should fall to some one whose judgment would command respect,
and the man who undertook it was Samuel Johnson. His dictionary,
the first edition of which, in two folio volumes, appeared
in 1755, was in many respects admirable, but it was inadequate
even as a standard of the then existing literary usage.
Johnson himself did not long entertain the belief that the natural
development of a language can be arrested in that or in any
other way. His work was, however, generally accepted as a final
authority, and the ideas upon which it was founded dominated
English lexicography for more than a century. The first effective
protest in England against the supremacy of this literary view was
made by Dean (later Archbishop) Trench, in a paper on &ldquo;Some
Deficiencies in Existing English Dictionaries&rdquo; read before the
Philological Society in 1857. &ldquo;A dictionary,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;according
to that idea of it which seems to me alone capable of being
logically maintained, is an <i>inventory of the language</i>; much more,
but this primarily.... It is no task of the maker of it to select
the <i>good</i> words of the language.... The business which he has
undertaken is to collect and arrange <i>all</i> words, whether good or
bad, whether they commend themselves to his judgment or otherwise....
<i>He is an historian of</i> [the language], <i>not a critic.</i>&rdquo;
That is, for the literary view of the chief end of the general
dictionary should be substituted the philological or scientific.
In Germany this substitution had already been effected by Jacob
and Wilhelm Grimm in their dictionary of the German language,
the first volume of which appeared in 1854. In brief, then, the
modern view is that the general dictionary of a language
should be a record of all the words&mdash;current or obsolete&mdash;of
that language, with all their meanings and uses, but should not
attempt to be, except secondarily or indirectly, a guide to
&ldquo;good&rdquo; usage. A &ldquo;standard&rdquo; dictionary has, in fact, been
recognized to be an impossibility, if not an absurdity.</p>

<p>This theoretical requirement must, of course, be modified
considerably in practice. The date at which a modern language
is to be regarded by the lexicographer as &ldquo;beginning&rdquo; must, as
a rule, be somewhat arbitrarily chosen; while considerable
portions of its earlier vocabulary cannot be recovered because
of the incompleteness of the literary record. Moreover, not even
the most complete dictionary can include all the words which the
records&mdash;earlier and later&mdash;actually contain. Many words, that
is to say, which are found in the literature of a language cannot
be regarded as, for lexicographic purposes, belonging to that
language; while many more may or may not be held to belong
to it, according to the judgment&mdash;almost the whim&mdash;of the
individual lexicographer. This is especially true of the English
tongue. &ldquo;That vast aggregate of words and phrases which
constitutes the vocabulary of English-speaking men presents, to
the mind that endeavours to grasp it as a definite whole, the
aspect of one of those nebulous masses familiar to the astronomer,
in which a clear and unmistakable nucleus shades off on all sides,
through zones of decreasing brightness, to a dim marginal film
that seems to end nowhere, but to lose itself imperceptibly in
the surrounding darkness&rdquo; (Dr J. A. H. Murray, <i>Oxford
Dict.</i> General Explanations, p. xvii). This &ldquo;marginal film&rdquo; of
words with more or less doubtful claims to recognition includes
thousands of the terms of the natural sciences (the New-Latin
classificatory names of zoology and botany, names of chemical
compounds and of minerals, and the like); half-naturalized
foreign words; dialectal words; slang terms; trade names
(many of which have passed or are passing into common use);
proper names and many more. Many of these even the most
complete dictionary should exclude; others it should include;
but where the line shall be drawn will always remain a vexed
question.</p>

<p>Another important principle upon which Trench insisted, and
which also expresses a requirement of modern scientific philology,
is that the dictionary shall be not merely a record, but also an
<i>historical</i> record of words and their uses. From the literary point
of view the most important thing is present usage. To that alone
the idea of a &ldquo;standard&rdquo; has any application. Dictionaries of
the older type, therefore, usually make the common, or &ldquo;proper&rdquo;
or &ldquo;root&rdquo; meaning of a word the starting point of its definition,
and arrange its other senses in a logical or accidental order
commonly ignoring the historical order in which the various
meanings arose. Still less do they attempt to give data from
which the vocabulary of the language at any previous period may
be determined. The philologist, however, for whom the growth,
or progressive alteration, of a language is a fact of central
importance, regards no record of a language as complete which
does not exhibit this growth in its successive stages. He desires
to know when and where each word, and each form and sense
of it, are first found in the language; if the word or sense is
obsolete, when it died; and any other fact that throws light upon
its history. He requires, accordingly, of the lexicographer that,
having ascertained these data, he shall make them the foundation
of his exposition&mdash;in particular, of the division and arrangement
of his definitions, that sense being placed first which appeared
first in order of time. In other words, each article in the dictionary
should furnish an orderly biography of the word of which it
treats, each word and sense being so dated that the exact time
of its appearance and the duration of its use may as nearly as
possible be determined. This, in principle, is the method of the
new lexicography. In practice it is subject to limitations similar
to those of the vocabulary mentioned above. Incompleteness
of the early record is here an even greater obstacle; and there
are many words whose history is, for one reason or another, so
unimportant that to treat it elaborately would be a waste of
labour and space.</p>

<p>The adoption of the historical principle involves a further noteworthy
modification of older methods, namely, an important
extension of the use of quotations. To Dr Johnson belongs the
credit of showing how useful, when properly chosen, they may be,
not only in corroborating the lexicographer&rsquo;s statements, but also
in revealing special shades of meaning or variations of use which
his definitions cannot well express. No part of Johnson&rsquo;s work
is more valuable than this. This idea was more fully developed
and applied by Dr Charles Richardson, whose <i>New Dictionary
of the English Language ... Illustrated by Quotations from the
Best Authors</i> (1835-1836) still remains a most valuable collection
of literary illustrations. Lexicographers, however, have, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>188</span>
few exceptions, until a recent date, employed quotations chiefly
for the ends just mentioned&mdash;as instances of use or as illustrations
of correct usage&mdash;with scarcely any recognition of their
value as historical evidence; and they have taken them almost
exclusively from the works of the &ldquo;best&rdquo; authors. But since all
the data upon which conclusions with regard to the history of
a word can be based must be collected from the literature of
the language, it is evident that, in so far as the lexicographer
is required to furnish evidence for an historical inference, a
quotation is the best form in which he can give it. In fact,
extracts, properly selected and grouped, are generally sufficient to
show the entire meaning and biography of a word without the aid
of elaborate definitions. The latter simply save the reader the
trouble of drawing the proper conclusions for himself. A further
rule of the new lexicography, accordingly, is that quotations
should be used, primarily, as historical evidence, and that the
history of words and meanings should be exhibited by means of
them. The earliest instance of use that can be found, and (if the
word or sense is obsolete) the latest, are as a rule to be given;
while in the case of an important word or sense, instances taken
from successive periods of its currency also should be cited.
Moreover, a quotation which contains an important bit of
historical evidence must be used, whether its source is &ldquo;good,&rdquo;
from the literary point of view, or not&mdash;whether it is a classic
of the language or from a daily newspaper; though where choice
is possible, preference should, of course, be given to quotations
extracted from the works of the best writers. This rule does not
do away with the illustrative use of quotations, which is still
recognized as highly important, but it subordinates it to their
historical use. It is necessary to add that it implies that the
extracts must be given exactly, and in the original spelling and
capitalization, accurately dated, and furnished with a precise
reference to author, book, volume, page and edition; for
insistence upon these requirements&mdash;which are obviously important,
whatever the use of the quotation may be&mdash;is one of the
most noteworthy of modern innovations. Johnson usually gave
simply the author&rsquo;s name, and often quoted from memory and
inaccurately; and many of his successors to this day have
followed&mdash;altogether or to some extent&mdash;his example.</p>

<p>The chief difficulty in the way of this use of quotations&mdash;after
the difficulty of collection&mdash;is that of finding space for them in a
dictionary of reasonable size. Preference must be given to those
which are essential, the number of those which are cited merely
on methodical grounds being made as small as possible. It is
hardly necessary to add that the negative evidence furnished by
quotations is generally of little value; one can seldom, that is,
be certain that the lexicographer has actually found the earliest
or the latest use, or that the word or sense has not been current
during some intermediate period from which he has no quotations.</p>

<p>Lastly, a much more important place in the scheme of the ideal
dictionary is now assigned to the <i>etymology</i> of words. This may
be attributed, in part, to the recent rapid development of etymology
as a science, and to the greater abundance of trustworthy
data; but it is chiefly due to the fact that from the historical
point of view the connexion between that section of the biography
of a word which lies within the language&mdash;subsequent, that is,
to the time when the language may, for lexicographical purposes,
be assumed to have begun, or to the time when the word was
adopted or invented&mdash;and its antecedent history has become more
vital and interesting. Etymology, in other words, is essentially
the history of the <i>form</i> of a word up to the time when it became
a part of the language, and is, in a measure, an extension of the
history of the development of the word in the language. Moreover,
it is the only means by which the exact relations of allied
words can be ascertained, and the separation of words of the same
form but of diverse origin (homonyms) can be effected, and is
thus, for the dictionary, the foundation of all <i>family history</i> and
correct <i>genealogy</i>. In fact, the attention that has been paid to
these two points in the best recent lexicography is one of its
distinguishing and most important characteristics. Related to
the etymology of words are the changes in their form which may
have occurred while they have been in use as parts of the language&mdash;modifications
of their pronunciation, corruptions by popular
etymology or false associations, and the like. The facts with
regard to these things which the wide research necessitated
by the historical method furnishes abundantly to the modern
lexicographer are often among the most novel and interesting
of his acquisitions.</p>

<p>It should be added that even approximate conformity to the
theoretical requirements of modern lexicography as above outlined
is possible only under conditions similar to those under which
the Oxford <i>New English Dictionary</i> was undertaken (see below).
The labour demanded is too vast, and the necessary bulk of the
dictionary too great. When, however, a language is recorded
in one such dictionary, those of smaller size and more modest
pretensions can rest upon it as an authority and conform to it
as a model so far as their special limitations permit.</p>

<p>The ideal thus developed is primarily that of the general
dictionary of the purely philological type, but it applies also to
the encyclopaedic dictionary. In so far as the latter is strictly
lexicographic&mdash;deals with words as words, and not with the things
they denote&mdash;it should be made after the model of the former,
and is defective to the extent in which it deviates from it. The
addition of encyclopaedic matter to the philological in no way
affects the general principles involved. It may, however, for
practical reasons, modify their application in various ways. For
example, the number of obsolete and dialectal words included
may be much diminished and the number of scientific terms (for
instance, new Latin botanical and zoological names) be increased;
and the relative amount of space devoted to etymologies and
quotations may be lessened. In general, since books of this kind
are designed to serve more or less as works of general reference,
the making of them must be governed by considerations of
practical utility which the compilers of a purely philological
dictionary are not obliged to regard. The encyclopaedic type
itself, although it has often been criticized as hybrid&mdash;as a mixture
of two things which should be kept distinct&mdash;is entirely defensible.
Between the dictionary and the encyclopaedia the dividing line
cannot sharply be drawn. There are words the meaning of which
cannot be explained fully without some description of things,
and, on the other hand, the description of things and processes
often involves the definition of names. To the combination of
the two objection cannot justly be made, so long as it is effected
in a way&mdash;with a selection of material&mdash;that leaves the dictionary
essentially a dictionary and not an encyclopaedia. Moreover,
the large vocabulary of the general dictionary makes it possible
to present certain kinds of encyclopaedic matter with a degree of
fulness and a convenience of arrangement which are possible in
no single work of any other class. In fact, it may be said that if
the encyclopaedic dictionary did not exist it would have to be
invented; that its justification is its indispensableness. Not
the least of its advantages is that it makes legitimate the use of
diagrams and pictorial illustrations, which, if properly selected
and executed, are often valuable aids to definition.</p>

<p>On its practical side the advance in lexicography has consisted
in the elaboration of methods long in use rather than in the invention
of new ones. The only way to collect the data upon which
the vocabulary, the definitions and the history are to be based
is, of course, to search for them in the written monuments of the
language, as all lexicographers who have not merely borrowed from
their predecessors have done. But the wider scope and special
aims of the new lexicography demand that the investigation shall
be vastly more comprehensive, systematic and precise. It is
necessary, in brief, that, as far as may be possible, the literature
(of all kinds) of every period of the language shall be examined
systematically, in order that all the words, and senses and forms
of words, which have existed during any period may be found,
and that enough excerpts (carefully verified, credited and dated) to
cover all the essential facts shall be made. The books, pamphlets,
journals, newspapers, and so on which must thus be searched will
be numbered by thousands, and the quotations selected may (as
in the case of the Oxford <i>New English Dictionary</i>) be counted by
millions. This task is beyond the powers of any one man, even
though he be a Johnson, or a Littré or a Grimm, and it is now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>189</span>
assigned to a corps of readers whose number is limited only by the
ability of the editor to obtain such assistance. The modern
method of editing the material thus accumulated&mdash;the actual
work of compilation&mdash;also is characterized by the application of
the principle of the division of labour. Johnson boasted that his
dictionary was written with but little assistance from the learned,
and the same was in large measure true of that of Littré. Such
attempts on the part of one man to write practically the whole of
a general dictionary are no longer possible, not merely because of
the vast labour and philological research necessitated by modern
aims, but more especially because the immense development of
the vocabulary of the special sciences renders indispensable the
assistance, in the work of definition, of persons who are expert in
those sciences. The tendency, accordingly, has been to enlarge
greatly the editorial staff of the dictionary, scores of sub-editors
and contributors being now employed where a dozen or fewer
were formerly deemed sufficient. In other words, the making of
a &ldquo;complete&rdquo; dictionary has become a co-operative enterprise,
to the success of which workers in all the fields of literature and
science contribute.</p>

<p>The most complete exemplification of these principles and
methods is the <i>Oxford New English Dictionary, on historical
principles, founded mainly on materials collected by the Philological
Society</i>. This monumental work originated in the suggestion
of Trench that an attempt should be made, under the
direction of the Philological Society, to complete the vocabulary
of existing dictionaries and to supply the historical information
which they lacked. The suggestion was adopted, considerable
material was collected, and Mr Herbert Coleridge was appointed
general editor. He died in 1861, and was succeeded by Dr F. J.
Furnivall. Little, however, was done, beyond the collection of
quotations&mdash;about 2,000,000 of which were gathered&mdash;until in
1878 the expense of printing and publishing the proposed
dictionary was assumed by the Delegates of the University Press,
and the editorship was entrusted to Dr (afterwards Sir) J. A. H.
Murray. As the historical point of beginning, the middle of the
12th century was selected, all words that were obsolete at that
date being excluded, though the history of words that were
current both before and after that date is given in its entirety;
and it was decided that the search for quotations&mdash;which, according
to the original design, was to cover the entire literature down
to the beginning of the 16th century and as much of the subsequent
literature (especially the works of the more important
writers and works on special subjects) as might be possible&mdash;should
be made more thorough. More than 800 readers, in all
parts of the world, offered their aid; and when the preface to the
first volume appeared in 1888, the editor was able to announce
that the readers had increased to 1300, and that 3,500,000 of
quotations, taken from the writings of more than 5000 authors,
had already been amassed. The whole work was planned to be
completed in ten large volumes, each issued first in smaller parts.
The first part was issued in 1884, and by the beginning of 1910
the first part of the letter S had been reached.</p>

<p>The historical method of exposition, particularly by quotations,
is applied in the <i>New English Dictionary</i>, if not in all cases
with entire success, yet, on the whole, with a regularity and a
precision which leave little to be desired. A minor fault is that
excerpts from second or third rate authors have occasionally been
used where better ones from writers of the first class either must
have been at hand or could have been found. As was said above,
the literary quality of the question is highly important even
in historical lexicography, and should not be neglected unnecessarily.
Other special features of the book are the completeness
with which variations of pronunciation and orthography
(with dates) are given; the fulness and scientific excellence of the
etymologies, which abound in new information and corrections
of old errors; the phonetic precision with which the present
(British) pronunciation is indicated; and the elaborate subdivision
of meanings. The definitions as a whole are marked by
a high degree of accuracy, though in a certain number of cases
(not explicable by the date of the volumes) the lists of meanings
are not so good as one would expect, as compared (say) with
the <i>Century Dictionary</i>. Work of such magnitude and quality is
possible, practically, only when the editor of the dictionary can command
not merely the aid of a very large number of scholars and
men of science, but their gratuitous aid. In this the <i>New English
Dictionary</i> has been singularly fortunate. The conditions under
which it originated, and its aim, have interested scholars everywhere,
and led them to contribute to the perfecting of it their
knowledge and time. The long list of names of such helpers in Sir
J. A. H. Murray&rsquo;s preface is in curious contrast with their absence
from Dr Johnson&rsquo;s and the few which are given in that of Littré.
The editor&rsquo;s principal assistants were Dr Henry Bradley and
Dr W. A. Craigie. Of the dictionary as a whole it may be said
that it is one of the greatest achievements, whether in literature
or science, of modern English scholarship and research.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The <i>New English Dictionary</i> furnishes for the first time data from
which the extent of the English word-store at any given period, and
the direction and rapidity of its growth, can fairly be estimated.
For this purpose the materials furnished by the older dictionaries are
quite insufficient, on account of their incompleteness and unhistorical
character. For example 100 pages of the <i>New English Dictionary</i>
(from the letter H) contain 1002 words, of which, as the dated quotations
show, 585 were current in 1750 (though some, of course, were
very rare, some dialectal, and so on), 191 were obsolete at that date,
and 226 have since come into use. But of the more than 700 words&mdash;current
or obsolete&mdash;which Johnson might thus have recorded, he
actually did record only about 300. Later dictionaries give more of
them, but they in no way show their status at the date in question.
It is worth noting that the figures given seem to indicate that not
very many more words have been added to the vocabulary of the
language during the past 150 years than had been lost by 1750. The
pages selected, however, contain comparatively few recent scientific
terms. A broader comparison would probably show that the gain
has been more than twice as great as the loss.</p>
</div>

<p>In the <i>Deutsches Wörterbuch</i> of Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm
the scientific spirit, as was said above, first found expression in
general lexicography. The desirability of a complete inventory
and investigation of German words was recognized by Leibnitz
and by various 18th-century scholars, but the plan and methods
of the Grimms were the direct product of the then new scientific
philology. Their design, in brief, was to give an exhaustive
account of the words of the literary language (New High German)
from about the end of the 15th century, including their earlier
etymological and later history, with references to important
dialectal words and forms; and to illustrate their use and history
abundantly by quotations. The first volume appeared in 1854.
Jacob Grimm (died 1863) edited the first, second (with his
brother, who died in 1859), third and a part of the fourth
volumes; the others have been edited by various distinguished
scholars. The scope and methods of this dictionary have been
broadened somewhat as the work has advanced. In general it
may be said that it differs from the <i>New English Dictionary</i>
chiefly in its omission of pronunciations and other pedagogic
matter; its irregular treatment of dates; its much less systematic
and less lucid statement of etymologies; its less systematic and
less fruitful use of quotations; and its less convenient and less
intelligible arrangement of material and typography.</p>

<p>These general principles lie also at the foundation of the
scholarly <i>Dictionnaire de la langue française</i> of E. Littré, though
they are there carried out less systematically and less completely.
In the arrangement of the definitions the first place is given to
the most primitive meaning of the word instead of to the most
common one, as in the dictionary of the Academy; but the other
meanings follow in an order that is often logical rather than
historical. Quotations also are frequently used merely as literary
illustrations, or are entirely omitted; in the special paragraphs
on the history of words before the 16th century, however, they
are put to a strictly historical use. This dictionary&mdash;perhaps the
greatest ever compiled by one man&mdash;was published 1863-1872.
(Supplement, 1878.)</p>

<p>The <i>Thesaurus Linguae Latinae</i>, prepared under the auspices of
the German Academies of Berlin, Göttingen, Leipzig, Munich
and Vienna, is a notable application of the principles and
practical co-operative method of modern lexicography to the
classical tongues. The plan of the work is to collect quotations
which shall register, with its full context, every word (except
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>190</span>
the most familiar particles) in the text of each Latin author
down to the middle of the 2nd century <span class="sc">a.d.</span>, and to extract
all important passages from all writers of the following
centuries down to the 7th; and upon these materials to found
a complete historical dictionary of the Latin language. The
work of collecting quotations was begun in 1894, and the first
part of the first volume has been published.</p>

<p>In the making of all these great dictionaries (except, of course,
the last) the needs of the general public as well as those of scholars
have been kept in view. But the type to which the general
dictionary designed for popular use has tended more and more
to conform is the <i>encyclopaedic</i>. This combination of lexicon
and encyclopaedia is exhibited in an extreme&mdash;and theoretically
objectionable&mdash;form in the <i>Grand dictionnaire universel du XIX<span class="sp">e</span>
siècle</i> of Pierre Larousse. Besides common words and their
definitions, it contains a great many proper names, with a
correspondingly large number of biographical, geographical,
historical and other articles, the connexion of which with the
strictly lexicographical part is purely mechanical. Its utility,
which&mdash;notwithstanding its many defects&mdash;is very great, makes
it, however, a model in many respects. Fifteen volumes were
published (1866-1876), and supplements were brought out later
(1878-1890). The <i>Nouveau Larousse illustré</i> started publication
in 1901, and was completed in 1904 (7 vols.). This is not an
abridgment or a fresh edition of the <i>Grand Dictionnaire</i> of Pierre
Larousse, but a new and distinct publication.</p>

<p>The most notable work of this class, in English, is the <i>Century
Dictionary</i>, an American product, edited by Professor W. D.
Whitney, and published 1889-1891 in six volumes, containing
7046 pages (large quarto). It conforms to the philological mode
in giving with great fulness the older as well as the present
vocabulary of the language, and in the completeness of its
etymologies; but it does not attempt to give the full history
of every word within the language. Among its other more noteworthy
characteristics are the inclusion of a great number of
modern scientific and technical words, and the abundance of its
quotations. The quotations are for the most part provided with
references, but they are not dated. Even when compared with
the much larger <i>New English Dictionary</i>, the <i>Century&rsquo;s</i> great
merit is the excellent enumeration of meanings, and the accuracy
of its explanations; in this respect it is often better and
fuller than the <i>New English</i>. In the application of the encyclopaedic
method this dictionary is conservative, excluding, with a
few exceptions, proper names, and restricting, for the most part,
the encyclopaedic matter to descriptive and other details which
may legitimately be added to the definitions. Its pictorial
illustrations are very numerous and well executed. In the
manner of its compilation it is a good example of modern cooperative
dictionary-making, being the joint product of a large
number of specialists. Next to the <i>New English Dictionary</i> it
is the most complete and scholarly of English lexicons.</p>

<p><i>Bibliography.</i>&mdash;The following list of dictionaries (from the 9th
edition of this work, with occasional corrections) is given for its
historical interest, but in recent years dictionary-making has been
so abundant that no attempt is made to be completely inclusive of
later works; the various articles on languages may be consulted
for these. The list is arranged geographically by families of
languages, or by regions. In each group the order, when not
alphabetical, is usually from north to south, extinct languages
generally coming first, and dialects being placed under their
language. Dictionaries forming parts of other works, such as
travels, histories, transactions, periodicals, reading-books, &amp;c.,
are generally excluded. The system here adopted was chosen
as on the whole the one best calculated to keep together
dictionaries naturally associated. The languages to be considered
are too many for an alphabetical arrangement, which ignores all
relations both natural and geographical, and too few to require a
strict classification by affinities, by which the European languages,
which for many reasons should be kept together, would be
dispersed. Under either system, Arabic, Persian and Turkish,
whose dictionaries are so closely connected, would be widely
separated. A wholly geographical arrangement would be inconvenient,
especially in Europe. Any system, however, which
attempts to arrange in a consecutive series the great network of
languages by which the whole world is enclosed, must be open
to some objections; and the arrangement adopted in this list
has produced some anomalies and dispersions which might cause
inconvenience if not pointed out. The old Italic languages
are placed under Latin, all dialects of France under French
(but Provençal as a distinct language), and Wallachian among
Romanic languages. Low German and its dialects are not
separated from High German. Basque is placed after Celtic;
Albanian, Gipsy and Turkish at the end of Europe, the last being
thus separated from its dialects and congeners in Northern
and Central Asia, among which are placed the Kazan dialect of
Tatar, Samoyed and Ostiak. Accadian is placed after Assyrian
among the Semitic languages, and Maltese as a dialect of Arabic;
while the Ethiopic is among African languages as it seemed
undesirable to separate it from the other Abyssinian languages,
or these from their neighbours to the north and south. Circassian
and Ossetic are joined to the first group of Aryan languages lying
to the north-west of Persia, and containing Armenian, Georgian
and Kurd. The following is the order of the groups, some of the
more important languages, that is, of those best provided with
dictionaries, standing alone:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Europe</span>: Greek, Latin, French, Romance, Teutonic (Scandinavian
and German), Celtic, Basque, Baltic, Slavonic, Ugrian,

<p><span class="bold">Greek.</span>&mdash;Athenaeus quotes 35 writers of works, known or supposed
to be dictionaries, for, as they are all lost, it is often difficult to
decide on their nature. Of these, Anticlides, who lived after the reign
of Alexander the Great, wrote <span class="grk" title="Exêgêtikos">&#904;&#958;&#951;&#947;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962;</span>, which seems to have been a
sort of dictionary, perhaps explaining the words and phrases occurring
in ancient stories. Zenodotus, the first superintendent of the great
library of Alexandria, who lived in the reigns of Ptolemy I. and Ptolemy
II., wrote <span class="grk" title="Glôssai">&#915;&#955;&#8182;&#963;&#963;&#945;&#953;</span>, and also <span class="grk" title="Lexeis ethnikai">&#923;&#941;&#958;&#949;&#953;&#962; &#7952;&#952;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#7984;</span>, a dictionary of barbarous or
foreign phrases. Aristophanes of Byzantium, son of Apelles the painter,
who lived in the reigns of Ptolemy II. and Ptolemy III., and had the
supreme management of the Alexandrian library, wrote a number
of works, as <span class="grk" title="Attikai Lexeis, Lakônikai Glôssai">&#902;&#964;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#943; &#923;&#941;&#958;&#949;&#953;&#962;, &#923;&#945;&#954;&#969;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#943; &#915;&#955;&#8182;&#963;&#963;&#945;&#953;</span> which, from the titles,
should be dictionaries, but a fragment of his <span class="grk" title="Lexeis">&#923;&#941;&#958;&#949;&#953;&#962;</span> printed by
Boissonade, in his edition of Herodian (London, 1869, 8vo, pp.
181-189), is not alphabetical. Artemidorus, a pupil of Aristophanes,
wrote a dictionary of technical terms used in cookery. Nicander
Colophonius, hereditary priest of Apollo Clarius, born at Claros,
near Colophon in Ionia, in reputation for 50 years, from 181 to
135, wrote <span class="grk" title="Glôssai">&#915;&#955;&#8182;&#963;&#963;&#945;&#953;</span> in at least three books. Parthenius, a pupil
of the Alexandrian grammarian Dionysius (who lived in the 1st
century before Christ), wrote on choice words used by historians.
Didymus, called <span class="grk" title="chalkenteros">&#967;&#945;&#955;&#954;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>, who, according to Athenaeus, wrote
3500 books, and, according to Seneca, 4000, wrote lexicons of the
tragic poets (of which book 28 is quoted), of the comic poets, of
ambiguous words and of corrupt expressions. Glossaries of Attic
words were written by Crates, Philemon, Philetas and Theodorus;
of Cretan, by Hermon or Hermonax; of Phrygian, by Neoptolemus;
of Rhodian, by Moschus; of Italian, by Diodorus of Tarsus; of
foreign words, by Silenus; of synonyms, by Simaristus; of cookery,
by Heracleon; and of drinking vessels, by Apollodorus of Cyrene.
According to Suidas, the most ancient Greek lexicographer was
Apollonius the sophist, son of Archibius. According to the common
opinion, he lived in the time of Augustus at Alexandria. He composed
a lexicon of words used by Homer, <span class="grk" title="Lexeis Homêrikai">&#923;&#941;&#958;&#949;&#953;&#962; &#908;&#956;&#951;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#943;</span>, a very
valuable and useful work, though much interpolated, edited by
Villoison, from a MS. of the 10th century, Paris, 1773, 4to, 2 vols.;
and by Tollius, Leiden, 1788, 8vo; ed. Bekker, Berlin, 1833, 8vo.
Erotian or Herodian, physician to Nero, wrote a lexicon on Hippocrates,
arranged in alphabetical order, probably by some copyist,
whom Klein calls &ldquo;homo sciolus.&rdquo; It was first published in
Greek in H. Stephani <i>Dictionarium Medicum</i>, Paris, 1564, 8vo; ed.
Klein, Lipsiae, 1865, 8vo, with additional fragments. Timaeus the
sophist, who, according to Ruhnken, lived in the 3rd century, wrote
a very short lexicon to Plato, which, though much interpolated, is of
great value, 1st ed. Ruhnken, Leiden, 1754; ed. locupletior, Lugd.
Bat. 1789, 8vo. Aelius Moeris, called the Atticist, lived about 190
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>191</span>
<span class="sc">a.d.</span>, and wrote an Attic lexicon, 1st ed. Hudson, Oxf. 1712, Bekker,
1833. Julius Pollux (<span class="grk" title="Ioulios Polydeukês">&#906;&#959;&#973;&#955;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#928;&#959;&#955;&#965;&#948;&#949;&#973;&#954;&#951;&#962;</span>) of Naucratis, in Egypt, died,
aged fifty-eight, in the reign of Commodus (180-192), who made him
professor of rhetoric at Athens. He wrote, besides other lost works,
an Onomasticon in ten books, being a classed vocabulary, intended to
supply all the words required by each subject with the usage of the
best authors. It is of the greatest value for the knowledge both of
language and of antiquities. First printed by Aldus, Venice, 1500,
fol.; often afterwards; ed. Lederlinus and Hemsterhuis, Amst. 1706,
2 vols.; Dindorf, 1824, 5 vols., Bethe (1900 f.). Harpocration of
Alexandria, probably of the 2nd century, wrote a lexicon on the ten
Attic orators, first printed by Aldus, Ven. 1503, fol.; ed. Dindorf,
Oxford, 1853, 8vo, 2 vols. from 14 MSS. Orion, a grammarian of
Thebes, in Egypt, who lived between 390 and 460, wrote an etymological
dictionary, printed by Sturz, Leipzig, 1820, 4to. Helladius
a priest of Jupiter at Alexandria, when the heathen temples there
were destroyed by Theophilus in 389 or 391 escaped to Constantinople,
where he was living in 408. He wrote an alphabetical lexicon, now
lost, chiefly of prose, called by Photius the largest (<span class="grk" title="polystichôtaton">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#965;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#967;&#974;&#964;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#957;</span>)
which he knew. Ammonius, professor of grammar at Alexandria,
and priest of the Egyptian ape, fled to Constantinople with Helladius,
and wrote a dictionary of words similar in sound but different in
meaning, which has been often printed in Greek lexicons, as Aldus,
1497, Stephanus, and separately by Valckenaer, Lugd. Bat. 1739,
4to, 2 vols., and by others. Zenodotus wrote on the cries of animals,
printed in Valckenaer&rsquo;s <i>Ammonius</i>; with this may be compared
the work of Vincentio Caralucci, <i>Lexicon vocum quae a brutis animalibus
emittuntur</i>, Perusia, 1779, 12mo. Hesychius of Alexandria wrote a
lexicon, important for the knowledge of the language and literature,
containing many dialectic and local expressions and quotations from
other authors, 1st ed. Aldus, Ven. 1514, fol.; the best is Alberti and
Ruhnken, Lugd. Bat. 1746-1766, fol. 2 vols.; collated with the MS.
in St Mark&rsquo;s library, Venice, the only MS. existing, by Niels Iversen
Schow, Leipzig, 1792, 8vo; ed. Schmidt, Jena, 1867, 8vo. The
foundation of this lexicon is supposed to have been that of Pamphilus,
an Alexandrian grammarian, quoted by Athenaeus, which, according
to Suidas, was in 95 books from &Epsilon; to &Omega;; &Alpha; to &Delta; had been compiled
by Zopirion. Photius, consecrated patriarch of Constantinople, 25th
December 857, living in 886, left a lexicon, partly extant, and printed
with Zonaras, Lips. 1808, 4to, 3 vols., being vol. iii.; ed. Naber,
Leidae, 1864-1865, 8vo, 2 vols. The most celebrated of the Greek
glossaries is that of Suidas, of whom nothing is known. He probably
lived in the 10th century. His lexicon is an alphabetical dictionary
of words including the names of persons and places&mdash;a compilation
of extracts from Greek writers, grammarians, scholiasts and lexicographers,
very carelessly and unequally executed. It was first
printed by Demetrius Chalcondylas, Milan, 1499, fol.; the best
edition, Bernhardy, Halle, 1853, 4to, 2 vols. John Zonaras, a celebrated
Byzantine historian and theologian, who lived in the 12th
century, compiled a lexicon, first printed by Tittmann, Lips. 1808.
4to, 2 vols. An anonymous Greek glossary, entitled <span class="grk" title="Etymologikon mega">&#904;&#964;&#965;&#956;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#957; &#956;&#941;&#947;&#945;</span>,
<i>Etymologicum magnum</i>, has been frequently printed. The first
edition is by Musurus, Venitia, 1499, fol.; the best by Gaisford,
Oxonii, 1848, fol. It contains many grammatical remarks by famous
authorities, many passages of authors, and mythological and
historical notices. The MSS. vary so much that they look like the
works of different authors. To Eudocia Augusta of Makrembolis, wife
of the emperors Constantine XI. and Romanus IV. (1059 to 1071),
was ascribed a dictionary of history and mythology, <span class="grk" title="Iônia">&#906;&#969;&#957;&#953;&#940;</span> (bed
of violets), first printed by D&rsquo;Ansse de Villoison, <i>Anecdota Graeca</i>,
Venetiis, 1781, 4to, vol. i. pp. 1-442. It was supposed to have been
of much value before it was published. Thomas, Magister Officiorum
under Andronicus Palaeologus, afterward called as a monk Theodulus,
wrote <span class="grk" title="Eklogai onomatôn Attikôn">&#904;&#954;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#945;&#8054; &#8000;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#902;&#964;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8182;&#957;</span>, printed by Callierges, Romae,

Aldus, Venetiis, 1497, fol.: Guarino, born about 1450 at Favora,
near Camarino, who called himself both Phavorinus and Camers,

<p>The French Academy, after five years&rsquo; consideration, began their
dictionary, on the 7th of February 1639, by examining the letter A,
which took them nine months to go through. The word Académie was
for some time omitted by oversight. They decided, on the 8th of March
1638, not to cite authorities, and they have since always claimed the
right of making their own examples. Olivier justifies them by saying
that for eighty years all the best writers belonged to their body, and
they could not be expected to cite each other. Their design was to
raise the language to its last perfection, and to open a road to reach
the highest eloquence. Antoine Furetière, one of their members,
compiled a dictionary which he says cost him forty years&rsquo; labour for
ten hours a day, and the manuscript filled fifteen chests. He gave
words of all kinds, especially technical, names of persons and places,
and phrases. As a specimen, he published his <i>Essai</i>, Paris, 1684,
4to; Amst. 1685, 12mo. The Academy charged him with using the
materials they had prepared for their dictionary, and expelled him, on
the 22nd of January 1685, for plagiarism. He died on the 14th of May
1688, in the midst of the consequent controversy and law suit. His
complete work was published, with a preface by Bayle, La Haye and
Rotterdam, 1690, fol., 3 vols.; again edited by Basnage de Beauval,
1701; La Haye, 1707, fol., 4 vols. From the edition of 1701 the
very popular so-called <i>Dictionnaire de Trevoux</i>, Trevoux, 1704, fol.,
2 vols., was made by the Jesuits, who excluded everything that
seemed to favour the Calvinism of Basnage. The last of its many
editions is Paris, 1771, fol., 8 vols. The Academy&rsquo;s dictionary was
first printed Paris, 1694, fol., 2 vols. They began the revision in 1700;

<p><span class="bold">Hebrew.</span>&mdash;About 875, Zema&#7717;, head of the school of Pumbeditha,
wrote a Talmudical dictionary of words and things, arranged
in alphabetical order, which is lost. About 880, Jehudah ben
&rsquo;Alan, of Tiberias, and Jehudah ibn Koreish, of Tahurt, in Morocco
wrote Hebrew dictionaries. Saadia ben Joseph (born 892, died 942),
of Fayum, in Upper Egypt, wrote <span title="Kefer Igaron">&#1503;&#1493;&#1512;&#1490;&#1488; &#1512;&#1508;&#1499;</span>, probably a Hebrew-Arabic
dictionary. Mena&#7717;em ben Jacob Ibn Sar&#363;q (born 910, died
about 970), of Tortosa and Cordova, wrote a copious Hebrew
dictionary, first printed by Herschell F. Filipowski, Edinburgh, 1855,
8vo, from five MSS. David ben Abraham, of F&#257;s, wrote, in Arabic,
a large Hebrew dictionary, the MS. of which, a quarto of 313 leaves
on cotton paper, was found about 1830 by A. Firkowitz, of Eupatoria,
in the cellar of a Qaraite synagogue in Jerusalem. The age of this
work cannot be ascertained. About 1050, Ali ben Suleiman wrote a
dictionary in Arabic, on the plan of that of David ben Abraham. The
MS. of 429 leaves belongs to Firkowitz. Haja ben Sherira, the
famous teacher of the Academy of Pumbeditha, wrote a Hebrew
dictionary in Arabic, called <i>al &#7716;&#257;vi</i> (The Gathering), arranged
alphabetically in the order of the last radical letter. This dictionary
is lost, as well as that of the Spaniard Isaac ben Saul, of Lucena.
Iona ibn Gana&#7717;, of Cordova, born about 985, wrote a Hebrew
dictionary in Arabic called <i>Kit&#257;b al Azul</i> (Book of Roots). This,
as well as a Hebrew translation by Samuel ibn Tab&#333;n, is extant
in MS., and was used by Gesenius in his <i>Thesaurus</i>. Rabbi David
ben Joseph &#7731;im&#7717;i died soon after 1232. His lexicon of roots, called
<span title="Shorashim">&#1501;&#1497;&#1513;&#1493;&#1513;</span>, was printed at Naples 1490, fol.; Constantinople, 1513, fol.;

Hoffmann printed this lexicon from Alif to Mim, from a Gotha MS.,
Kiel, 1874, 4to. Joshua bar Bahlul, living 963, wrote another, great
part of which Castelli put into his lexicon. His MS. is now at
Cambridge, and, with those at Florence and Oxford, was used by
Bernstein. Elias bar Shinaya, born 975, metropolitan of Nisibis,
1009, wrote a Syriac and Arabic lexicon, entitled <i>Kit&#257;b &#363;t Tarjuman

Khalil (who died before A.H. 175 [<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 791], aged seventy-four): the

<p><span class="bold">Chinese.</span>&mdash;Native Dictionaries are very numerous. Many are
very copious and voluminous, and have passed through many
editions. <i>Shwo wan</i>, by Hü Shin, is a collection of the ancient characters,
about 10,000 in number, arranged under 540 radicals, published
150 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, usually in 12 vols.: <i>Yu pien</i>, by Ku Ye Wang, published
<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 530, arranged under 542 radicals, is the basis of the Chinese

1711, 131 vols. 8vo, prepared by 66 doctors of the Han lin Academy
in seven years. It contains 10,362 characters, and countless combinations
of two, three or four characters, forming compound words
and idioms, with numerous and copious quotations. According to
Williams (<i>On the word Shin</i>, p. 79), an English translation would fill
140 volumes octavo of 1000 pages each. <i>Kanghi tsze tien</i> (Kanghi&rsquo;s
Standard or Canon of the Character), the dictionary of Kanghi, the
first emperor of the present dynasty, was composed by 30 members
of the Han lin, and published in 1716, 40 vols. 4to, with a preface by
the emperor. It contains 49,030 characters, arranged under the 214
radicals. It is generally in 12 vols., and is universally used in China,
being the standard authority among native scholars for the readings
as well as the meanings of characters. <span class="sc">Latin</span>.&mdash;De Guignes (French,

Possibly the Latin Ephemeris was the work of Septimius himself.

<p><span class="bold">DICUIL<a name="ar47" id="ar47"></a></span> (fl. 825), Irish monastic scholar, grammarian and
geographer. He was the author of the <i>De mensura orbis terrae</i>,
finished in 825, which contains the earliest clear notice of a
European discovery of and settlement in Iceland and the most
definite Western reference to the old freshwater canal between
the Nile and the Red Sea, finally blocked up in 767. In 795
(February 1-August 1) Irish hermits had visited Iceland; on
their return they reported the marvel of the perpetual day at
midsummer in &ldquo;Thule,&rdquo; where there was then &ldquo;no darkness to
hinder one from doing what one would.&rdquo; These eremites also
navigated the sea north of Iceland on their first arrival, and
found it ice-free for one day&rsquo;s sail, after which they came to
the ice-wall. Relics of this, and perhaps of other Irish religious
settlements, were found by the permanent Scandinavian colonists
of Iceland in the 9th century. Of the old Egyptian freshwater
canal Dicuil learnt from one &ldquo;brother Fidelis,&rdquo; probably another
Irish monk, who, on his way to Jerusalem, sailed along the
&ldquo;Nile&rdquo; into the Red Sea&mdash;passing on his way the &ldquo;Barns of
Joseph&rdquo; or Pyramids of Giza, which are well described. Dicuil&rsquo;s
knowledge of the islands north and west of Britain is evidently
intimate; his references to Irish exploration and colonization,
and to (more recent) Scandinavian devastation of the same, as
far as the Faeroes, are noteworthy, like his notice of the elephant
sent by Harun al-Rashid (in 801) to Charles the Great, the most
curious item in a political and diplomatic intercourse of high
importance. Dicuil&rsquo;s reading was wide; he quotes from, or
refers to, thirty Greek and Latin writers, including the classical
Homer, Hecataeus, Herodotus, Thucydides, Virgil, Pliny and
King Juba, the sub-classical Solinus, the patristic St Isidore and
Orosius, and his contemporary the Irish poet Sedulius;&mdash;in
particular, he professes to utilize the alleged surveys of the
Roman world executed by order of Julius Caesar, Augustus and
Theodosius (whether Theodosius the Great or Theodosius II.
is uncertain). He probably did not know Greek; his references
to Greek authors do not imply this. Though certainly Irish
by birth, it has been conjectured (from his references to
Sedulius and the caliph&rsquo;s elephant) that he was in later life
in an Irish monastery in the Frankish empire. Letronne inclines
to identify him with Dicuil or Dichull, abbot of Pahlacht,
born about 760.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>There are seven chief MSS. of the <i>De mensura</i> (Dicuil&rsquo;s tract
on grammar is lost); of these the earliest and best are (1) Paris,

<p><span class="bold">DIDACH&#274;, THE,<a name="ar48" id="ar48"></a></span> or <i>Teaching of the (twelve) Apostles</i>,&mdash;the
most important of the recent recoveries in the region of early
Christian literature (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Apocryphal Literature</a></span>). It was
previously known by name from lists of canonical and extra-canonical
books compiled by Eusebius and other writers. Moreover,
it had come to be suspected by several scholars that a lost
book, variously entitled <i>The Two Ways</i> or <i>The Judgment of Peter</i>,
had been freely used in a number of works, of which mention
must presently be made. In 1882 a critical reconstruction of
this book was made by Adam Krawutzcky with marvellous
accuracy, as was shown when in the very next year the Greek
bishop and metropolitan, Philotheus Bryennius, published <i>The
Teaching of the Twelve Apostles</i> from the same manuscript from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>201</span>
which he had previously published the complete form of the
Epistle of Clement.<a name="fa1e" id="fa1e" href="#ft1e"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p><i>The Didach&#275;</i>, as we now have it in the Greek, falls into two
marked divisions: (a) a book of moral precepts, opening with the
words, &ldquo;There are two ways&rdquo;; (b) a manual of church ordinances,
linked on to the foregoing by the words, &ldquo;Having first
said all these things, baptize, &amp;c.&rdquo; Each of these must be
considered separately before we approach the question of the
locality and date of the whole book in its present form.</p>

<p>1. <i>The Two Ways.</i>&mdash;The author of the complete work, as we
now have it, has modified the original <i>Two Ways</i> by inserting near
the beginning a considerable section containing, among other
matter, passages from the Sermon on the Mount, in which the
language of St Matthew&rsquo;s Gospel is blended with that of St
Luke&rsquo;s. He has also added at the close a few sentences, beginning,
&ldquo;If thou canst not bear (the whole yoke of the Lord), bear
what thou canst&rdquo; (vi. 2); and among minor changes he has
introduced, in dealing with confession, reference to &ldquo;the church&rdquo;
(iv. 14). No part of this matter is to be found in the following
documents, which present us in varying degrees of accuracy with
<i>The Two Ways</i>: (i.) the Epistle of Barnabas, chaps. xix., xx. (in
which the order of the book has been much broken up, and a
good deal has been omitted); (ii.) the <i>Ecclesiastical Canons of the
Holy Apostles</i>, usually called the <i>Apostolic Church Order</i>, a book
which presents a parallel to the <i>Teaching</i>, in so far as it consists
first of a form of <i>The Two Ways</i>, and secondly of a number of
church ordinances (here, however, as in the Syriac <i>Didascalia</i>,
which gives about the same amount of <i>The Two Ways</i>, various
sections are ascribed to individual apostles, <i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;John said,
There are two ways,&rdquo; &amp;c.); (iii.) a discourse of the Egyptian
monk Schnudi (d. 451), preserved in Arabic (see Iselin, <i>Texte
u. Unters.</i>, 1895); (iv.) a Latin version, of which a fragment
was published by O. von Gebhardt in 1884, and the whole by
J. Schlecht in 1900. When by the aid of this evidence <i>The Two
Ways</i> is restored to us free of glosses, it has the appearance of
being a Jewish manual which has been carried over into the
use of the Christian church. This is of course only a probable
inference; there is no prototype extant in Jewish literature, and,
comparing the moral (non-doctrinal) instruction for Christian
catechumens in Hermas, <i>Shepherd</i> (<i>Mand.</i> i.-ix.), no real need to
assume one. There was a danger of admitting Gentile converts
to the church on too easy moral terms; hence the need of such
insistence on the ideal as in The Two Ways and the <i>Mandates</i>.
The recent recovery of the Latin version is of singular interest,
as showing that, even without the distinctively Christian
additions and interpolations which our full form of the <i>Teaching</i>
presents, it was circulating under the title <i>Doctrina apostolorum</i>.<a name="fa2e" id="fa2e" href="#ft2e"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>

<p>2. The second part of our <i>Teaching</i> might be called a church
directory. It consists of precepts relating to church life, which
are couched in the second person plural; whereas <i>The Two Ways</i>
uses throughout the second person singular. It appears to be
a composite work. First (vii. 1-xi. 2) is a short sacramental
manual intended for the use of local elders or presbyters, though
such are not named, for they were not yet a distinctive order or
clergy. This section was probably added to <i>The Two Ways</i> before
the addition of the remainder. It orders baptism in the threefold
name, making a distinction as to waters which has Jewish
parallels, and permitting a threefold pouring on the head, if
sufficient water for immersion cannot be had. It prescribes a
fast before baptism for the baptizer as well as the candidate.
Fasts are to be kept on Wednesday and Friday, not Monday and
Thursday, which are the fast days of &ldquo;the hypocrites,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> by
a perversion of the Lord&rsquo;s words, the Jews. &ldquo;Neither pray ye as
the hypocrites; but as the Lord commanded in His Gospel.&rdquo;
Then follows the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, almost exactly as in St Matthew,
with a brief doxology&mdash;&ldquo;for Thine is the power and the glory
forever.&rdquo; This is to be said three times a day. Next come three
eucharistic prayers, the language of which is clearly marked off
from that of the rest of the book, and shows parallels with the
diction of St John&rsquo;s Gospel. They are probably founded on
Jewish thanksgivings, and it is of interest to note that a portion
of them is prescribed as a grace before meat in (pseudo-)
Athanasius&rsquo; <i>De virginitate</i>. A trace of them is found in one of the
liturgical prayers of Serapion, bishop of Thmui, in Egypt, but
they have left little mark on the liturgies of the church. As in
Ignatius and other early writers, the eucharist, a real meal (x. 1)
of a family character, is regarded as producing immortality
(cf. &ldquo;spiritual food and drink and eternal life&rdquo;). None are to
partake of it save those who have been &ldquo;baptized in the name
of the Lord&rdquo; (an expression which is of interest in a document
which prescribes the threefold formula). The prophets are not
to be confined to these forms, but may &ldquo;give thanks as much as
they will.&rdquo; This appears to show that a prophet, if present,
would naturally preside over the eucharist. The next section
(xi. 3-xiii.) deals with the ministry of spiritual gifts as exercised
by apostles, prophets and teachers. An apostle is to be &ldquo;received
as the Lord&rdquo;; but he must follow the Gospel precepts,
stay but one or two days, and take no money, but only bread
enough for a day&rsquo;s journey. Here we have that wider use of the
term &ldquo;apostle&rdquo; to which Lightfoot had already drawn attention.
A prophet, on the contrary, may settle if he chooses, and in that
case he is to receive tithes and first-fruits; &ldquo;for they are your
high priests.&rdquo; If he be once approved as a true prophet, his
words and acts are not to be criticized; for this is the sin that
shall not be forgiven. Next comes a section (xiv., xv.) reflecting
a somewhat later development concerning fixed services and
ministry; the desire for a stated service, and the need of regular
provision for it, is leading to a new order of things. The
eucharist is to be celebrated every Lord&rsquo;s Day, and preceded by
confession of sins, &ldquo;that your sacrifice may be pure ... for this
is that sacrifice which was spoken of by the Lord, In every place
and time to offer unto Me a pure sacrifice. Appoint therefore
unto yourselves bishops and deacons, worthy of the Lord, men
meek and uncovetous, and true and approved; for they also
minister unto you the ministration of the prophets and teachers.
Therefore despise them not; for they are your honoured ones,
together with the prophets and teachers.&rdquo; This is an arrangement
recommended by one who has tried it, and he reassures the
old-fashioned believer who clings to the less formal régime (and
whose protest was voiced in the Montanist movement), that there
will be no spiritual loss under the new system. The book closes
(chap. xvi.) with exhortations to steadfastness in the last days,
and to the coming of the &ldquo;world-deceiver&rdquo; or Antichrist, which
will precede the coming of the Lord. This section is perhaps the
actual utterance of a Christian prophet, and may be of earlier
origin than the two preceding sections.</p>

<p>3. It will now be clear that indications of the locality and date
of our present <i>Teaching</i> must be sought for only in the second
part, and in the Christian interpolations in the first part. We
have no ground for thinking that the second part ever existed
independently as a separate book. The whole work was in the
hands of the writer of the seventh book of the <i>Apostolic Constitutions</i>,
who embodies almost every sentence of it, interspersing
it with passages of Scripture, and modifying the precepts of the
second part to suit a later (4th-century) stage of church development;
this writer was also the interpolator of the Epistles of
Ignatius, and belonged to the Syrian Church. Whether the
second part was known to the writer of the <i>Apostolic Church
Order</i> is not clear, as his only quotation of it comes from one of the
eucharistic prayers. The allusions of early writers seem to point
to Egypt, but their references are mostly to the first part, so that
we must be careful how we argue from them as to the provenance
of the book as a whole. Against Egypt has been urged the
allusion in one of the eucharistic prayers to &ldquo;corn upon the
mountains.&rdquo; This is found in the Prayer-book of Serapion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>202</span>
(c. 350) but omitted in a later Egyptian prayer; the form as
we have it in <i>The Didach&#275;</i> may have passed into Egypt with
the authority of tradition which was afterwards weakened. The
anti-Jewish tone of the second part suggests the neighbourhood
of Jews, from whom the Christians were to be sharply distinguished.
Either Egypt or Syria would satisfy this condition,
and in favour of Syria is the fact that the presbyterate there was
to a late date regarded as a rank rather than an office. If we can
connect the injunctions (vi. 3) concerning (abstinence from certain)
food and that which is offered to idols with the old trouble that
arose at Antioch (Acts xv. 1) and was legislated for by the
Jerusalem council, we have additional support for the Syrian
claim. But all that we can safely say as to locality is that the
community here represented seems to have been isolated, and
out of touch with the larger centres of Christian life.</p>

<p>This last consideration helps us in discussing the question of
date. For such an isolated community may have preserved
primitive customs for some time after they had generally disappeared.
Certainly the stage of development is an early one, as
is shown, <i>e.g.</i>, by the prominence of prophets, and the need that
was felt for the vindication of the position of the bishops and
deacons (there is no mention at all of presbyters); moreover,
there is no reference to a canon of Scripture (though the written
Gospel is expressly mentioned) or to a creed. On the other hand
the &ldquo;apostles&rdquo; of the second part are obviously not &ldquo;the
twelve apostles&rdquo; of the title; and the prophets seem in some
instances to have proved unworthy of their high position. The
ministry of enthusiasm which they represent is about to give way
to the ministry of office, a transition which is reflected in the New
Testament in the 3rd Epistle of John. Three of the Gospels have
clearly been for some time in circulation; St Matthew&rsquo;s is used
several times, and there are phrases which occur only in St Luke&rsquo;s,
while St John&rsquo;s Gospel lies behind the eucharistic prayers which
the writer has embodied in his work. There are no indications
of any form of doctrinal heresy as needing rebuke; the warnings
against false teaching are quite general. While the first part
must be dated before the Epistle of Barnabas, <i>i.e.</i> before <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 90,
it seems wisest not to place the complete work much earlier than
<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 120, and there are passages which may well be later.</p>

<p>A large literature has sprung up round The <i>Didach&#275;</i> since 1884.
Harnack&rsquo;s edition in <i>Texte u. Unters.</i> vol. ii. (1884) is indispensable
to the student; and his discussions in <i>Altchristl. Litteratur</i> and
<i>Chronologie</i> give clear summaries of his work. Other editions of the
text are those of F. X. Funk, <i>Patres Apostolici</i>, vol. i. (Tübingen,
1901); H. Lietzmann (Bonn, 1903; with Latin version). Dr J. E.
Odgers has published an English translation with introduction and
notes (London, 1906). Dr C. Taylor in 1886 drew attention to some
important parallels in Jewish literature; his edition contains an
English translation. Dr Rendel Harris published in 1887 a complete
facsimile, and gathered a great store of patristic illustration. Text
and translation will also be found in Lightfoot&rsquo;s <i>Apostolic Fathers</i>

Bartlet in the extra volume of Hastings&rsquo;s <i>Dictionary of the Bible</i>;

word <span class="grk" title="didaktikos">&#948;&#953;&#948;&#945;&#954;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962;</span> signifies a teacher, from the verb <span class="grk" title="didaskein">&#948;&#953;&#948;&#940;&#963;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>,
and poetry of the class under discussion approaches us with the
arts and graces of a schoolmaster. At no time was it found
convenient to combine lyrical verse with instruction, and therefore
from the beginning of literature the didactic poets have
chosen a form approaching the epical. Modern criticism, which
discourages the epic, and is increasingly anxious to limit the word
&ldquo;poetry&rdquo; to lyric, is inclined to exclude the term &ldquo;didactic
poetry&rdquo; from our nomenclature, as a phrase absurd in itself.
It is indeed more than probable that didactic verse is hopelessly
obsolete. Definite information is now to be found in a thousand
shapes, directly and boldly presented in clear and technical prose.
No farmer, however elegant, will, any longer choose to study
agriculture in hexameters, or even in Tusser&rsquo;s shambling metre.
The sciences and the professions will not waste their time on
methods of instruction which must, from their very nature, be
artless, inexact and vague. But in the morning of the world, those
who taught with authority might well believe that verse was the
proper, nay, the only serious vehicle of their instruction. What
they knew was extremely limited, and in its nature it was
simple and straightforward; it had little technical subtlety; it
constantly lapsed into the fabulous and the conjectural. Not
only could what early sages knew, or guessed, about astronomy
and medicine and geography be conveniently put into rolling
verse, but, in the absence of all written books, this was the
easiest way in which information could be made attractive to the
ear and be retained by the memory.</p>

<p>In the prehistoric dawn of Greek civilization there appear
to have been three classes of poetry, to which the literature of
Europe looks back as to its triple fountain-head. There were
romantic epics, dealing with the adventures of gods and heroes;
these Homer represents. There were mystic chants and religious
odes, purely lyrical in character, of which the best Orphic Hymns
must have been the type. And lastly there was a great body of
verse occupied entirely with increasing the knowledge of citizens in
useful branches of art and observation; these were the beginnings
of didactic poetry, and we class them together under the dim name
of Hesiod. It is impossible to date these earliest didactic poems,
which nevertheless set the fashion of form which has been
preserved ever since. The <i>Works and Days</i>, which passes as the
direct masterpiece of Hesiod (<i>q.v.</i>), is the type of all the poetry
which has had education as its aim. Hesiod is supposed to have
been a tiller of the ground in a Boeotian village, who determined
to enrich his neighbours&rsquo; minds by putting his own ripe stores of
useful information into sonorous metre. Historically examined,
the legend of Hesiod becomes a shadow, but the substance of
the poems attributed to him remains. The genuine parts of
the <i>Works and Days</i>, which Professor Gilbert Murray has called
&ldquo;a slow, lowly, simple poem,&rdquo; deal with rules for agriculture.
The <i>Theogony</i> is an annotated catalogue of the gods. Other
poems attributed to Hesiod, but now lost, were on astronomy, on
auguries by birds, on the character of the physical world; still
others seem to have been genealogies of famous women. All this
mass of Boeotian verse was composed for educational purposes,
in an age when even preposterous information was better than
no knowledge at all. In slightly later times, as the Greek nation
became better supplied with intellectual appliances, the stream
of didactic poetry flowed more and more closely in one, and that
a theological, channel. The great poem of Parmenides <i>On Nature</i>
and those of Empedocles exist only in fragments, but enough
remains to show that these poets carried on the didactic method
in mythology. Cleostratus of Tenedos wrote an astronomical
poem in the 6th century, and Periander a medical one in the
4th, but didactic poetry did not flourish again in Greece until
the 3rd century, when Aratus, in the Alexandrian age, wrote his
famous <i>Phenomena</i>, a poem about things seen in the heavens.
Other later Greek didactic poets were Nicander, and perhaps
Euphorion.</p>

<p>It was from the hands of these Alexandrian writers that the
genius of didactic poetry passed over to Rome, since, although it
is possible that some of the lost works of the early republic, and in
particular those of Ennius, may have possessed an educational
character, the first and by far the greatest didactic Latin poet
known to us is Lucretius. A highly finished translation by
Cicero into Latin hexameters of the principal works of Aratus is
believed to have drawn the attention of Lucretius to this school
of Greek poetry, and it was not without reference to the Greeks,
although in a more archaic and far purer taste, that he composed,
in the 1st century before Christ, his magnificent <i>De rerum
natura</i>. By universal consent, this is the noblest didactic poem
in the literature of the world. It was intended to instruct mankind
in the interpretation and in the working of the system of
philosophy revealed by Epicurus, which at that time was exciting
the sympathetic attention of all classes of Roman society. What
gave the poem of Lucretius its extraordinary interest, and what
has prolonged and even increased its vitality, was the imaginative
and illustrative insight of the author, piercing and lighting up the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>203</span>
recesses of human experience. On a lower intellectual level, but
of a still greater technical excellence, was the <i>Georgics</i> of Virgil,
a poem on the processes of agriculture, published about 30 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>
The brilliant execution of this famous work has justly made it the
type and unapproachable standard of all poetry which desires
to impart useful information in the guise of exquisite literature.
Himself once a farmer on the banks of the Mincio, Virgil, at the
apex of his genius, set himself in his Campanian villa to recall
whatever had been essential in the agricultural life of his boyish
home, and the result, in spite of the ardours of the subject, was
what J. W. Mackail has called &ldquo;the most splendid literary production
of the Empire.&rdquo; In the rest of surviving Latin didactic
poetry, the influence and the imitation of Virgil and Lucretius
are manifest. Manilius, turning again to Alexandria, produced
a fine <i>Astronomica</i> towards the close of the reign of Augustus.
Columella, regretting that Virgil had omitted to sing of gardens,
composed a smooth poem on horticulture. Natural philosophy
inspired Lucilius junior, of whom a didactic poem on Etna
survives. Long afterwards, under Diocletian, a poet of Carthage,
Nemesianus, wrote in the manner of Virgil the <i>Cynegetica</i>, a
poem on hunting with dogs, which has had numerous imitations
in later European literatures. These are the most important
specimens of didactic poetry which ancient Rome has handed
down to us.</p>

<p>In Anglo-Saxon and early English poetic literature, and
especially in the religious part of it, an element of didacticism is
not to be overlooked. But it would be difficult to say that anything
of importance was written in verse with the sole purpose of
imparting information, until we reach the 16th century. Some of
the later medieval allegories are didactic or nothing. The first
poem, however, which we can in any reasonable way compare
with the classic works of which we have been speaking is the
<i>Hundreth Pointes of Good Husbandrie</i>, published in 1557 by
Thomas Tusser; these humble Georgics aimed at a practical
description of the whole art of English farming. Throughout the
early part of the 17th century, when our national poetry was in
its most vivid and brilliant condition, the last thing a poet
thought of doing was the setting down of scientific facts in
rhyme. We come across, however, one or two writers who were
as didactic as the age would permit them to be, Samuel Daniel with
his philosophy, Fulke Greville, Lord Brooke with his &ldquo;treatises&rdquo;
of war and monarchy. After the Restoration, as the lyrical
element rapidly died out of English poetry, there was more and
more room left for educational rhetoric in verse. The poems
about prosody, founded upon Horace, and signed by John
Sheffield, 3rd earl of Mulgrave (1648-1721), and Lord Roscommon,
were among the earliest purely didactic verse-studies in English.
John Philips deserves a certain pre-eminence, as his poem called
Cyder, in 1706, set the fashion which lasted all down the 18th
century, of writing precisely in verse about definite branches of
industry or employment. None of the greater poets of the age of
Anne quite succumbed to the practice, but there is a very distinct
flavour of the purely didactic about a great deal of the verse of
Pope and Gay. In such productions as Gilbert West&rsquo;s (1703-1756)
<i>Education</i>, Dyer&rsquo;s <i>Fleece</i>, and Somerville&rsquo;s <i>Chase</i>, we see
technical information put forward as the central aim of the poet.
Instead of a passionate pleasure, or at least an uplifted enthusiasm,
being the poet&rsquo;s object, he frankly admits that, first and
foremost, he has some facts about wool or dogs or schoolmasters
which he wishes to bring home to his readers, and that, secondly,
he consents to use verse, as brilliantly as he can, for the purpose
of gilding the pill and attracting an unwilling attention. As we
descend the 18th century, these works become more and more
numerous, and more dry, especially when opposed by the descriptive
and rural poets of the school of Thomson, the poet of
<i>The Seasons</i>. But Thomson himself wrote a huge poem of
<i>Liberty</i> (1732), for which we have no name if we must not call it
didactic. Even Gray began, though he failed to finish, a work of
this class, on <i>The Alliance of Education and Government</i>. These
poems were discredited by the publication of <i>The Sugar-Cane</i>
(1764), a long verse-treatise about the cultivation of sugar by
negroes in the West Indies, by James Grainger (1721-1766), but,
though liable to ridicule, such versified treatises continued to
appear. Whether so great a writer as Cowper is to be counted
among the didactic poets is a question on which readers of <i>The
Task</i> may be divided; this poem belongs rather to the class of
descriptive poetry, but a strong didactic tendency is visible in
parts of it. Perhaps the latest frankly educational poem which
enjoyed a great popularity was <i>The Course of Time</i> by Robert
Pollok (1798-1827), in which a system of Calvinistic divinity is
laid down with severity and in the pomp of blank verse. This
kind of literature had already been exposed, and discouraged, by
the teaching of Wordsworth, who had insisted on the imperative
necessity of charging all poetry with imagination and passion.
Oddly enough, <i>The Excursion</i> of Wordsworth himself is perhaps
the most didactic poem of the 19th century, but it must be
acknowledged that his influence, in this direction, was saner
than his practice. Since the days of Coleridge and Shelley it
has been almost impossible to conceive a poet of any value composing
in verse a work written with the purpose of inculcating
useful information.</p>

<p>The history of didactic poetry in France repeats, in great
measure, but in drearier language, that of England. Boileau, like
Pope, but with a more definite purpose as a teacher, offered
instruction in his <i>Art poétique</i> and in his <i>Epistles</i>. But his
doctrine was always literary, not purely educational. At the
beginning of the 18th century, the younger Racine (1692-1763)
wrote sermons in verse, and at the close of it the Abbé Delille
(1738-1813) tried to imitate Virgil in poems about horticulture.
Between these two there lies a vast mass of verse written for the
indulgence of intellect rather than at the dictates of the heart;
wherever this aims at increasing knowledge, it at once becomes
basely and flatly didactic. There is nothing in French literature
of the transitional class that deserves mention beside <i>The Task</i> or
<i>The Excursion</i>.</p>

<p>During the century which preceded the Romantic revival of
poetry in Germany, didactic verse was cultivated in that country
on the lines of imitation of the French, but with a greater dryness
and on a lower level of utility. Modern German literature
began with Martin Opitz (1597-1639) and the Silesian School,
who were in their essence rhetorical and educational, and who
gave their tone to German verse. Albrecht von Haller (1708-1777)
brought a very considerable intellectual force to bear on
his huge poems, <i>The Origin of Evil</i>, which was theological, and
<i>The Alps</i> (1729), botanical and topographical. Johann Peter Uz
(1720-1796) wrote a <i>Theodicée</i>, which was very popular, and not
without dignity. Johann Jacob Dusch (1725-1787) undertook to
put <i>The Sciences</i> into the eight books of a great didactic poem.
Tiedge (1752-1840) was the last of the school; in a once-famous
<i>Urania</i>, he sang of God and Immortality and Liberty. These
German pieces were the most unswervingly didactic that any
modern European literature has produced. There was hardly
the pretence of introducing into them descriptions of natural
beauty, as the English poets did, or of grace and wit like the
French. The German poets simply poured into a lumbering
mould of verse as much solid information and direct instruction
as the form would hold.</p>

<p>Didactic poetry has, in modern times, been antipathetic to
the spirit of the Latin peoples, and neither Italian nor Spanish
literature has produced a really notable work in this class. An
examination of the poems, ancient and modern, which have been
mentioned above, will show that from primitive times there have
been two classes of poetic work to which the epithet didactic has
been given. It is desirable to distinguish these a little more
exactly. One is the pure instrument of teaching, the poetry
which desires to impart all that it knows about the growing of
cabbages or the prevention of disasters at sea, the revolution of
the planets or the blessings of inoculation. This is didactic poetry
proper, and this, it is almost certain, became irrevocably obsolete
at the close of the 18th century. No future Virgil will give the
world a second <i>Georgics</i>. But there is another species which it
is very improbable that criticism has entirely dislodged; that is
the poetry which combines, with philosophical instruction, an impetus
of imaginative movement, and a certain definite cultivation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>204</span>
of fire and beauty. In hands so noble as those of Lucretius
and Goethe this species of didactic poetry has enriched the world
with durable masterpieces, and, although the circle of readers
which will endure scientific disquisition in the bonds of verse
grows narrower and narrower, it is probable that the great poet
who is also a great thinker will now and again insist on being
heard. In Sully-Prudhomme France has possessed an eminent
writer whose methods are directly instructive, and both <i>La
Justice</i> (1878) and <i>Le Bonheur</i> (1888) are typically didactic poems.
Perhaps future historians may name these as the latest of their
class.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DIDEROT, DENIS<a name="ar50" id="ar50"></a></span> (1713-1784), French man of letters and
encyclopaedist, was born at Langres on the 5th of October 1713.
He was educated by the Jesuits, like most of those who afterwards
became the bitterest enemies of Catholicism; and, when
his education was at an end, he vexed his brave and worthy
father&rsquo;s heart by turning away from respectable callings, like law
or medicine, and throwing himself into the vagabond life of a
bookseller&rsquo;s hack in Paris. An imprudent marriage (1743) did
not better his position. His wife, Anne Toinette Champion, was
a devout Catholic, but her piety did not restrain a narrow and
fretful temper, and Diderot&rsquo;s domestic life was irregular and
unhappy. He sought consolation for chagrins at home in attachments
abroad, first with a Madame Puisieux, a fifth-rate female
scribbler, and then with Sophie Voland, to whom he was constant
for the rest of her life. His letters to her are among the most
graphic of all the pictures that we have of the daily life of the
philosophic circle in Paris. An interesting contrast may be
made between the Bohemianism of the famous English literary
set who supped at the Turk&rsquo;s Head with the Tory Johnson and
the Conservative Burke for their oracles, and the Bohemianism of
the French set who about the same time dined once a week at the
baron D&rsquo;Holbach&rsquo;s, to listen to the wild sallies and the inspiring
declamations of Diderot. For Diderot was not a great writer;
he stands out as a fertile, suggestive and daring thinker, and a
prodigious and most eloquent talker.</p>

<p>Diderot&rsquo;s earliest writings were of as little importance as
Goldsmith&rsquo;s <i>Enquiry into the State of Polite Learning</i> or Burke&rsquo;s
<i>Abridgement of English History</i>. He earned 100 crowns by
translating Stanyan&rsquo;s <i>History of Greece</i> (1743); with two
colleagues he produced a translation of James&rsquo;s <i>Dictionary of
Medicine</i> (1746-1748) and about the same date he published a
free rendering of Shaftesbury&rsquo;s <i>Inquiry Concerning Virtue and
Merit</i> (1745), with some original notes of his own. With strange
and characteristic versatility, he turned from ethical speculation
to the composition of a volume of stories, the <i>Bijoux indiscrets</i>
(1748), gross without liveliness, and impure without wit. In later
years he repented of this shameless work, just as Boccaccio is
said in the day of his grey hairs to have thought of the sprightliness
of the <i>Decameron</i> with strong remorse. From tales Diderot
went back to the more congenial region of philosophy. Between
the morning of Good Friday and the evening of Easter Monday he
wrote the <i>Pensées philosophiques</i> (1746), and he presently added
to this a short complementary essay on the sufficiency of natural
religion. The gist of these performances is to press the ordinary
rationalistic objections to a supernatural revelation; but though
Diderot did not at this time pass out into the wilderness
beyond natural religion, yet there are signs that he accepted that
less as a positive doctrine, resting on grounds of its own, than as
a convenient point of attack against Christianity. In 1747 he
wrote the <i>Promenade du sceptique</i>, a rather poor allegory&mdash;pointing
first to the extravagances of Catholicism; second, to the
vanity of the pleasures of that world which is the rival of
the church; and third, to the desperate and unfathomable
uncertainty of the philosophy which professes to be so high
above both church and world.</p>

<p>Diderot&rsquo;s next piece was what first introduced him to the world
as an original thinker, his famous <i>Lettre sur les aveugles</i> (1749).
The immediate object of this short but pithy writing was to show
the dependence of men&rsquo;s ideas on their five senses. It considers
the case of the intellect deprived of the aid of one of the senses;
and in a second piece, published afterwards, Diderot considered
the case of a similar deprivation in the deaf and dumb. The
<i>Lettre sur les sourds et muets</i>, however, is substantially a digressive
examination of some points in aesthetics. The philosophic
significance of the two essays is in the advance they make
towards the principle of Relativity. But what interested the
militant philosophers of that day was an episodic application
of the principle of relativity to the master-conception of God.
What makes the <i>Lettre sur les aveugles</i> interesting is its presentation,
in a distinct though undigested form, of the modern theory
of variability, and of survival by superior adaptation. It is worth
noticing, too, as an illustration of the comprehensive freedom
with which Diderot felt his way round any subject that he
approached, that in this theoretic essay he suggests the possibility
of teaching the blind to read through the sense of touch. If the
<i>Lettre sur les aveugles</i> introduced Diderot into the worshipful
company of the philosophers, it also introduced him to the
penalties of philosophy. His speculation was too hardy for the
authorities, and he was thrown into the prison of Vincennes.
Here he remained for three months; then he was released, to
enter upon the gigantic undertaking of his life.</p>

<p>The bookseller Lebreton had applied to him with a project
for the publication of a translation into French of Ephraim
Chambers&rsquo;s <i>Cyclopaedia</i>, undertaken in the first instance by an
Englishman, John Mills, and a German, Gottfried Sellius (for
particulars see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Encyclopaedia</a></span>). Diderot accepted the proposal,
but in his busy and pregnant intelligence the scheme became
transformed. Instead of a mere reproduction of Chambers, he
persuaded the bookseller to enter upon a new work, which should
collect under one roof all the active writers, all the new ideas, all
the new knowledge, that were then moving the cultivated class
to its depths, but still were comparatively ineffectual by reason of
their dispersion. His enthusiasm infected the publishers; they
collected a sufficient capital for a vaster enterprise than they had
at first planned; D&rsquo;Alembert was persuaded to become Diderot&rsquo;s
colleague; the requisite permission was procured from the
government; in 1750 an elaborate prospectus announced the
project to a delighted public; and in 1751 the first volume was
given to the world. The last of the letterpress was issued in
1765, but it was 1772 before the subscribers received the final
volumes of the plates. These twenty years were to Diderot years
not merely of incessant drudgery, but of harassing persecution,
of sufferings from the cabals of enemies, and of injury from the
desertion of friends. The ecclesiastical party detested the
<i>Encyclopaedia</i>, in which they saw a rising stronghold for their
philosophic enemies. By 1757 they could endure the sight no
longer. The subscribers had grown from 2000 to 4000, and this
was a right measure of the growth of the work in popular influence
and power. To any one who turns over the pages of these redoubtable
volumes now, it seems surprising that their doctrines
should have stirred such portentous alarm. There is no atheism,
no overt attack on any of the cardinal mysteries of the faith, no
direct denunciation even of the notorious abuses of the church.
Yet we feel that the atmosphere of the book may well have been
displeasing to authorities who had not yet learnt to encounter
the modern spirit on equal terms. The <i>Encyclopaedia</i> takes for
granted the justice of religious tolerance and speculative freedom.
It asserts in distinct tones the democratic doctrine that it is
the common people in a nation whose lot ought to be the main
concern of the nation&rsquo;s government. From beginning to end
it is one unbroken process of exaltation of scientific knowledge on
the one hand, and pacific industry on the other. All these things
were odious to the old governing classes of France; their spirit
was absolutist, ecclesiastical and military. Perhaps the most
alarming thought of all was the current belief that the <i>Encyclopaedia</i>
was the work of an organized band of conspirators against
society, and that a pestilent doctrine was now made truly
formidable by the confederation of its preachers into an open
league. When the seventh volume appeared, it contained an
article on &ldquo;Geneva,&rdquo; written by D&rsquo;Alembert. The writer
contrived a panegyric on the pastors of Geneva, of which every
word was a stinging reproach to the abbés and prelates of
Versailles. At the same moment Helvétius&rsquo;s book, <i>L&rsquo;Esprit</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>205</span>
appeared, and gave a still more profound and, let us add, a more
reasonable shock to the ecclesiastical party. Authority could
brook no more, and in 1759 the <i>Encyclopaedia</i> was formally
suppressed.</p>

<p>The decree, however, did not arrest the continuance of the
work. The connivance of the authorities at the breach of their
own official orders was common in those times of distracted
government. The work went on, but with its difficulties increased
by the necessity of being clandestine. And a worse thing
than troublesome interference by the police now befell Diderot.
D&rsquo;Alembert, wearied of shifts and indignities, withdrew from
the enterprise. Other powerful colleagues, Turgot among them,
declined to contribute further to a book which had acquired
an evil fame. Diderot was left to bring the task to an end as he
best could. For seven years he laboured like a slave at the oar.
He wrote several hundred articles, some of them very slight, but
many of them most laborious, comprehensive and ample. He
wore out his eyesight in correcting proofs, and he wearied his soul
in bringing the manuscript of less competent contributors into
decent shape. He spent his days in the workshops, mastering the
processes of manufactures, and his nights in reproducing on paper
what he had learnt during the day. And he was incessantly
harassed all the time by alarms of a descent from the police. At
the last moment, when his immense work was just drawing to
an end, he encountered one last and crowning mortification: he
discovered that the bookseller, fearing the displeasure of the
government, had struck out from the proof sheets, after they had
left Diderot&rsquo;s hands, all passages that he chose to think too hardy.
The monument to which Diderot had given the labour of twenty
long and oppressive years was irreparably mutilated and defaced.
It is calculated that the average annual salary received by
Diderot for his share in the <i>Encyclopaedia</i> was about £120
sterling. &ldquo;And then to think,&rdquo; said Voltaire, &ldquo;that an army
contractor makes £800 in a day!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Although the <i>Encyclopaedia</i> was Diderot&rsquo;s monumental work,
he is the author of a shower of dispersed pieces that sowed nearly
every field of intellectual interest with new and fruitful ideas.
We find no masterpiece, but only thoughts for masterpieces; no
creation, but a criticism with the quality to inspire and direct
creation. He wrote plays&mdash;<i>Le Fils naturel</i> (1757) and <i>Le Père de
famille</i> (1758)&mdash;and they are very insipid performances in the sentimental
vein. But he accompanied them by essays on dramatic
poetry, including especially the <i>Paradoxe sur le comédien</i>, in
which he announced the principles of a new drama,&mdash;the serious,
domestic, bourgeois drama of real life, in opposition to the stilted
conventions of the classic French stage. It was Diderot&rsquo;s lessons
and example that gave a decisive bias to the dramatic taste of
Lessing, whose plays, and his <i>Hamburgische Dramaturgie</i> (1768),
mark so important an epoch in the history of the modern theatre.
In the pictorial art, Diderot&rsquo;s criticisms are no less rich, fertile
and wide in their ideas. His article on &ldquo;Beauty&rdquo; in the
<i>Encyclopaedia</i> shows that he had mastered and passed beyond
the metaphysical theories on the subject, and the <i>Essai sur la
peinture</i> was justly described by Goethe, who thought it worth
translating, as &ldquo;a magnificent work, which speaks even more
helpfully to the poet than to the painter, though to the painter
too it is as a blazing torch.&rdquo; Diderot&rsquo;s most intimate friend was
Grimm, one of the conspicuous figures of the philosophic body.
Grimm wrote news-letters to various high personages in Germany,
reporting what was going on in the world of art and literature
in Paris, then without a rival as the capital of the intellectual
activity of Europe. Diderot helped his friend at one time and
another between 1759 and 1779, by writing for him an account
of the annual exhibitions of paintings. These <i>Salons</i> are among
the most readable of all pieces of art criticism. They have a
freshness, a reality, a life, which take their readers into a different
world from the dry and conceited pedantries of the ordinary
virtuoso. As has been said by Sainte-Beuve, they initiated the
French into a new sentiment, and introduced people to the
mystery and purport of colour by ideas. &ldquo;Before Diderot,&rdquo;
Madame Necker said, &ldquo;I had never seen anything in pictures
except dull and lifeless colours; it was his imagination that gave
them relief and life, and it is almost a new sense for which I am
indebted to his genius.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Greuze was Diderot&rsquo;s favourite among contemporary artists,
and it is easy to see why. Greuze&rsquo;s most characteristic pictures
were the rendering in colour of the same sentiment of domestic
virtue and the pathos of common life, which Diderot attempted
with inferior success to represent upon the stage. For Diderot
was above all things interested in the life of men,&mdash;not the
abstract life of the race, but the incidents of individual character,
the fortunes of a particular family, the relations of real and
concrete motives in this or that special case. He delighted with
the enthusiasm of a born casuist in curious puzzles of right
and wrong, and in devising a conflict between the generalities of
ethics and the conditions of an ingeniously contrived practical
dilemma. Mostly his interest expressed itself in didactic and
sympathetic form; in two, however, of the most remarkable
of all his pieces, it is not sympathetic, but ironical. <i>Jacques le
fataliste</i> (written in 1773, but not published until 1796) is in
manner an imitation of <i>Tristram Shandy</i> and <i>The Sentimental
Journey</i>. Few modern readers will find in it any true diversion.
In spite of some excellent criticisms dispersed here and there,
and in spite of one or two stories that are not without a certain
effective realism, it must as a whole be pronounced savourless,
forced, and as leaving unmoved those springs of laughter and
of tears which are the common fountain of humour. <i>Le Neveu
de Rameau</i> is a far superior performance. If there were any inevitable
compulsion to name a masterpiece for Diderot, one must
select this singular &ldquo;farce-tragedy.&rdquo; Its intention has been
matter of dispute; whether it was designed to be merely a satire
on contemporary manners, or a reduction of the theory of self-interest
to an absurdity, or the application of an ironical clincher
to the ethics of ordinary convention, or a mere setting for a
discussion about music, or a vigorous dramatic sketch of a
parasite and a human original. There is no dispute as to its
curious literary flavour, its mixed qualities of pungency, bitterness,
pity and, in places, unflinching shamelessness. Goethe&rsquo;s
translation (1805) was the first introduction of <i>Le Neveu de
Rameau</i> to the European public. After executing it, he gave
back the original French manuscript to Schiller, from whom he
had it. No authentic French copy of it appeared until the writer
had been nearly forty years in his grave (1823).</p>

<p>It would take several pages merely to contain the list of
Diderot&rsquo;s miscellaneous pieces, from an infinitely graceful trifle
like the <i>Regrets sur ma vieille robe de chambre</i> up to <i>Le Rêve de
D&rsquo;Alembert</i>, where he plunges into the depths of the controversy
as to the ultimate constitution of matter and the meaning of life.
It is a mistake to set down Diderot for a coherent and systematic
materialist. We ought to look upon him &ldquo;as a philosopher in
whom all the contradictions of the time struggle with one another&rdquo;
(Rosenkranz). That is to say, he is critical and not dogmatic.
There is no unity in Diderot, as there was in Voltaire or in
Rousseau. Just as in cases of conduct he loves to make new
ethical assumptions and argue them out as a professional sophist
might have done, so in the speculative problems as to the organization
of matter, the origin of life, the compatibility between
physiological machinery and free will, he takes a certain standpoint,
and follows it out more or less digressively to its consequences.
He seizes a hypothesis and works it to its end, and
this made him the inspirer in others of materialist doctrines
which they held more definitely than he did. Just as Diderot
could not attain to the concentration, the positiveness, the
finality of aim needed for a masterpiece of literature, so he could
not attain to those qualities in the way of dogma and system.
Yet he drew at last to the conclusions of materialism, and contributed
many of its most declamatory pages to the <i>Système de la
nature</i> of his friend D&rsquo;Holbach,&mdash;the very Bible of atheism, as
some one styled it. All that he saw, if we reduce his opinions to
formulae, was motion in space: &ldquo;attraction and repulsion, the
only truth.&rdquo; If matter produces life by spontaneous generation,
and if man has no alternative but to obey the compulsion of
nature, what remains for God to do?</p>

<p>In proportion as these conclusions deepened in him, the more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>206</span>
did Diderot turn for the hope of the race to virtue; in other
words, to such a regulation of conduct and motive as shall make
us tender, pitiful, simple, contented. Hence his one great literary
passion, his enthusiasm for Richardson, the English novelist.
Hence, also, his deepening aversion for the political system of
France, which makes the realization of a natural and contented
domestic life so hard. Diderot had almost as much to say
against society as even Rousseau himself. The difference between
them was that Rousseau was a fervent theist. The atheism of
the Holbachians, as he called Diderot&rsquo;s group, was intolerable
to him; and this feeling, aided by certain private perversities of
humour, led to a breach of what had once been an intimate
friendship between Rousseau and Diderot (1757). Diderot was
still alive when Rousseau&rsquo;s <i>Confessions</i> appeared, and he was so
exasperated by Rousseau&rsquo;s stories about Grimm, then and always
Diderot&rsquo;s intimate, that in 1782 he transformed a life of Seneca,
that he had written four years earlier, into an <i>Essai sur les règnes
de Claude et de Néron</i> (1778-1782), which is much less an account
of Seneca than a vindication of Diderot and Grimm, and is one of
the most rambling and inept productions in literature. As for the
merits of the old quarrel between Rousseau and Diderot, we may
agree with the latter, that too many sensible people would be in
the wrong if Jean Jacques was in the right.</p>

<p>Varied and incessant as was Diderot&rsquo;s mental activity, it was
not of a kind to bring him riches. He secured none of the posts
that were occasionally given to needy men of letters; he could
not even obtain that bare official recognition of merit which was
implied by being chosen a member of the Academy. The time
came for him to provide a dower for his daughter, and he saw
no other alternative than to sell his library. When the empress
Catherine of Russia heard of his straits, she commissioned an
agent in Paris to buy the library at a price equal to about £1000
of English money, and then handsomely requested the philosopher
to retain the books in Paris until she required them, and to
constitute himself her librarian, with a yearly salary. In 1773
Diderot started on an expedition to thank his imperial benefactress
in person, and he passed some months at St Petersburg.
The empress received him cordially. The strange pair passed their
afternoons in disputes on a thousand points of high philosophy,
and they debated with a vivacity and freedom not usual in
courts. &ldquo;<i>Fi, donc,</i>&rdquo; said Catherine one day, when Diderot
hinted that he argued with her at a disadvantage, &ldquo;<i>is there any
difference among men?</i>&rdquo; Diderot returned home in 1774. Ten
years remained to him, and he spent them in the industrious
acquisition of new knowledge, in the composition of a host of
fragmentary pieces, some of them mentioned above, and in
luminous declamations with his friends. All accounts agree that
Diderot was seen at his best in conversation. &ldquo;He who only
knows Diderot in his writings,&rdquo; says Marmontel, &ldquo;does not know
him at all. When he grew animated in talk, and allowed his
thoughts to flow in all their abundance, then he became truly
ravishing. In his writings he had not the art of ensemble; the
first operation which orders and places everything was too slow
and too painful to him.&rdquo; Diderot himself was conscious of the
want of literary merit in his pieces. In truth he set no high value
on what he had done. It is doubtful whether he was ever alive to
the waste that circumstance and temperament together made of
an intelligence from which, if it had been free to work systematically,
the world of thought had so much to hope. He was one
of those simple, disinterested and intellectually sterling workers
to whom their own personality is as nothing in presence of the
vast subjects that engage the thoughts of their lives. He wrote
what he found to write, and left the piece, as Carlyle has said,
&ldquo;on the waste of accident, with an ostrich-like indifference.&rdquo;
When he heard one day that a collected edition of his works was
in the press at Amsterdam, he greeted the news with &ldquo;peals of
laughter,&rdquo; so well did he know the haste and the little heed with
which those works had been dashed off.</p>

<p>Diderot died on the 30th of July 1784, six years after Voltaire
and Rousseau, one year after his old colleague D&rsquo;Alembert, and
five years before D&rsquo;Holbach, his host and intimate for a lifetime.
Notwithstanding Diderot&rsquo;s peals of laughter at the thought, an
elaborate and exhaustive collection of his writings in twenty
stout volumes, edited by MM. Assézat and Tourneux, was completed
in 1875-1877.</p>

two months (March 28-June 2) during the year <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 193. He
was the grandson of the famous jurist Salvius Julianus (under
Hadrian and the Antonines), and the son of a distinguished
general, who might have ascended the throne after the death of
Antoninus Pius, had not his loyalty to the ruling house prevented
him. Didius filled several civil and military offices with distinguished
success, but subsequently abandoned himself to
dissipation. On the death of Pertinax, the praetorian guards
offered the throne to the highest bidder. Flavius Sulpicianus,
the father-in-law of Pertinax and praefect of the city, had already
made an offer; Didius, urged on by the members of his family,
his freedmen and parasites, hurried to the praetorian camp to
contend for the prize. He and Sulpicianus bid against each
other, and finally the throne was knocked down to Didius. The
senate and nobles professed their loyalty; but the people
made no attempt to conceal their indignation at this insult to
the state, and the armies of Britain, Syria and Illyricum broke
out into open revolt. Septimius Severus, the commander of
the Pannonian legions, was declared emperor and hastened by
forced marches to Italy. Didius, abandoned by the praetorians,
was condemned and executed by order of the senate, which at
once acknowledged Severus.</p>

Africa, daughter of the Tyrian king Metten (Mutto, Methres,
Belus), wife of Acerbas (more correctly Sicharbas; Sychaeus in
Virgil), a priest of Hercules. Her husband having been slain by
her brother Pygmalion, Dido fled to Cyprus, and thence to the
coast of Africa, where she purchased from a local chieftain
Iarbas a piece of land on which she built Carthage. The city
soon began to prosper and Iarbas sought Dido&rsquo;s hand in marriage,
threatening her with war in case of refusal. To escape from him,
Dido constructed a funeral pile, on which she stabbed herself
before the people (Justin xviii. 4-7). Virgil, in defiance of the
usually accepted chronology, makes Dido a contemporary of
Aeneas, with whom she fell in love after his landing in Africa, and
attributes her suicide to her abandonment by him at the command
of Jupiter (<i>Aeneid</i>, iv.). Dido was worshipped at Carthage as a
divinity under the name of Caelestis, the Roman counterpart of
Tanit, the tutelary goddess of Carthage. According to Timaeus,
the oldest authority for the story, her name was Theiosso, in
Phoenician Helissa, and she was called Dido from her wanderings,
Dido being the Phoenician equivalent of <span class="grk" title="planêtis">&#960;&#955;&#945;&#957;&#8134;&#964;&#953;&#962;</span> (<i>Etymologicum

<p><span class="bold">DIDON, HENRI<a name="ar53" id="ar53"></a></span> (1840-1900), French Dominican, was born
at Trouvet, Isère, on the 17th of March 1840. He joined the
Dominicans, under the influence of Lacordaire, in 1858, and
completed his theological studies at the Minerva convent at
Rome. The influence of Lacordaire was shown in the zeal displayed
by Didon in favour of a reconciliation between philosophy
and science. In 1871 his fame had so much grown that he was
chosen to deliver the funeral oration over the murdered archbishop
of Paris, Monseigneur G. Darboy. He also delivered some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>207</span>
discourses at the church of St Jean de Beauvais in Paris on the
relations between science and religion; but his utterances,
especially on the question of divorce, were deemed suspicious by
his superiors, and his intimacy with Claude Bernard the physiologist
was disapproved. He was interdicted from preaching and
sent into retirement at the convent of Corbara in Corsica. After
eighteen months he emerged, and travelled in Germany, publishing
an interesting work upon that country, entitled <i>Les Allemands</i>
(English translation by R. Ledos de Beaufort, London, 1884).
On his return to France in 1890 he produced his best known
work, <i>Jésus-Christ</i> (2 vols., Paris), for which he had qualified
himself by travel in the Holy Land. In the same year he became
director of the Collège Albert-le-Grand at Arcueil, and founded
three auxiliary institutions, École Lacordaire, École Laplace and
École St Dominique. He wrote, in addition, several works on
educational questions, and augmented his fame as an eloquent
preacher by discourses preached during Lent and Advent. He
died at Toulouse on the 13th of March 1900.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIDOT,<a name="ar54" id="ar54"></a></span> the name of a family of learned French printers and
publishers. <span class="sc">François Didot</span> (1689-1757), founder of the
family, was born at Paris. He began business as a bookseller and
printer in 1713, and among his undertakings was a collection
of the travels of his friend the Abbé Prévost, in twenty volumes
(1747). It was remarkable for its typographical perfection,
and was adorned with many engravings and maps. <span class="sc">François
Ambroise Didot</span> (1730-1804), son of François, made important
improvements in type-founding, and was the first to attempt
printing on vellum paper. Among the works which he published
was the famous collection of French classics prepared by order
of Louis XVI. for the education of the Dauphin, and the folio
edition of <i>L&rsquo;Art de vérifier les dates</i>. <span class="sc">Pierre François Didot</span>
(1732-1795), his brother, devoted much attention to the art of
type-founding and to paper-making. Among the works which
issued from his press was an edition in folio of the <i>Imitatio
Christi</i> (1788). <span class="sc">Henri Didot</span> (1765-1852), son of Pierre François,
is celebrated for his &ldquo;microscopic&rdquo; editions of various standard
works, for which he engraved the type when nearly seventy years
of age. He was also the engraver of the <i>assignats</i> issued by the
Constituent and Legislative Assemblies and the Convention.
<span class="sc">Didot Saint-Léger</span>, second son of Pierre François, was the
inventor of the paper-making machine known in England as
the Didot machine. <span class="sc">Pierre Didot</span> (1760-1853), eldest son of
François Ambroise, is celebrated as the publisher of the beautiful
&ldquo;Louvre&rdquo; editions of Virgil, Horace and Racine. The Racine,
in three volumes folio, was pronounced in 1801 to be &ldquo;the most
perfect typographical production of all ages.&rdquo; <span class="sc">Firmin Didot</span>
(1764-1836), his brother, second son of François Ambroise,
sustained the reputation of the family both as printer and type-founder.
He revived (if he did not invent&mdash;a distinction which
in order of time belongs to William Ged) the process of stereotyping,
and coined its name, and he first used the process in his
edition of Callet&rsquo;s <i>Tables of Logarithms</i> (1795), in which he secured
an accuracy till then unattainable. He published stereotyped
editions of French, English and Italian classics at a very low
price. He was the author of two tragedies&mdash;<i>La Reine de
Portugal</i> and <i>La Mort d&rsquo;Annibal</i>; and he wrote metrical translations
from Virgil, Tyrtaeus and Theocritus. <span class="sc">Ambroise Firmin
Didot</span> (1790-1876) was his eldest son. After receiving a classical
education, he spent three years in Greece and in the East; and on
the retirement of his father in 1827 he undertook, in conjunction
with his brother Hyacinthe, the direction of the publishing
business. Their greatest undertaking was a new edition of the
<i>Thesaurus Graecae linguae</i> of Henri Estienne, under the editorial
care of the brothers Dindorf and M. Hase (9 vols., 1855-1859).
Among the numerous important works published by the brothers,
the 200 volumes forming the <i>Bibliothèque des auteurs grecs</i>,
<i>Bibliothèque latine</i>, and <i>Bibliothèque française</i> deserve special
mention. Ambroise Firmin Didot was the first to propose
(1823) a subscription in favour of the Greeks, then in insurrection
against Turkish tyranny. Besides a translation of Thucydides
(1833), he wrote the articles &ldquo;Estienne&rdquo; in the <i>Nouvelle Biographie
générale</i>, and &ldquo;Typographie&rdquo; in the <i>Ency. mod.</i>, as well
as <i>Observations sur l&rsquo;orthographie française</i> (1867), &amp;c. In 1875
he published a very learned and elaborate monograph on Aldus
Manutius. His collection of MSS., the richest in France, was
said to have been worth, at the time of his death, not less than
2,000,000 francs.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DIDRON, ADOLPHE NAPOLÉON<a name="ar55" id="ar55"></a></span> (1806-1867), French
archaeologist, was born at Hautvillers, in the department of
Marne, on the 13th of March 1806. At first a student of law,
he began in 1830, by the advice of Victor Hugo, a study of the
Christian archaeology of the middle ages. After visiting and
examining the principal churches, first of Normandy, then of
central and southern France, he was on his return appointed by
Guizot secretary to the Historical Committee of Arts and Monuments
(1835); and in the following years he delivered several
courses of lectures on Christian iconography at the Bibliothèque
Royale. In 1839 he visited Greece for the purpose of examining
the art of the Eastern Church, both in its buildings and its
manuscripts. In 1844 he originated the <i>Annales archéologiques</i>,
a periodical devoted to his favourite subject, which he edited
until his death. In 1845 he established at Paris a special archaeological
library, and at the same time a manufactory of painted
glass. In the same year he was admitted to the Legion of
Honour. His most important work is the <i>Iconographie chrétienne</i>,
of which, however, the first portion only, <i>Histoire de Dieu</i> (1843),
was published. It was translated into English by E. J. Millington.
Among his other works may be mentioned the <i>Manuel d&rsquo;iconographie
chrétienne grecque et latine</i> (1845), the <i>Iconographie des
chapiteaux du palais ducal de Venise</i> (1857), and the <i>Manuel des
objets de bronze et d&rsquo;orfèvrerie</i> (1859). He died on the 13th of
November 1867.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DIDYMI,<a name="ar56" id="ar56"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Didyma</span> (mod. <i>Hieronta</i>), an ancient sanctuary
of Apollo in Asia Minor situated in the territory of Miletus, from
which it was distant about 10 m. S. and on the promontory
Poseideion. It was sometimes called <i>Branchidae</i> from the name
of its priestly caste which claimed descent from Branchus, a
youth beloved by Apollo. As the seat of a famous oracle, the
original temple attracted offerings from Pharaoh Necho (in whose
army there was a contingent of Milesian mercenaries), and the
Lydian Croesus, and was plundered by Darius of Persia. Xerxes
finally sacked and burnt it (481 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>) and exiled the Branchidae
to the far north-east of his empire. This exile was believed to
be voluntary, the priests having betrayed their treasures to the
Persian; and on this belief Alexander the Great acted 150 years
later, when, finding the descendants of the Branchidae established
in a city beyond the Oxus, he ordered them to be exterminated
for the sin of their fathers (328). The celebrated cult-statue of
Apollo by Canachus, familiar to us from reproductions on Milesian
coins, was also carried to Persia, there to remain till restored by
Seleucus I. in 295, and the oracle ceased to speak for a century
and a half. The Milesians were not able to undertake the rebuilding
till about 332 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, when the oracle revived at the bidding
of Alexander. The work proved too costly, and despite a special
effort made by the Asian province nearly 400 years later, at the
bidding of the emperor Caligula, the structure was never quite
finished: but even as it was, Strabo ranked the Didymeum the
greatest of Greek temples and Pliny placed it among the four
most splendid and second only to the Artemisium at Ephesus.
In point of fact it was a little smaller than the Samian Heraeum
and the temple of Cybele at Sardis, and almost exactly the same
size as the Artemisium. The area covered by the platform
measures roughly 360 × 160 ft.</p>

<p>When Cyriac of Ancona visited the spot in 1446, it seems that
the temple was still standing in great part, although the <i>cella</i> had
been converted into a fortress by the Byzantines: but when the
next European visitor, the Englishman Dr Pickering, arrived
in 1673, it had collapsed. It is conjectured that the cause was
the great earthquake of 1493. The Society of Dilettanti sent two
expeditions to explore the ruins, the first in 1764 under Richard
Chandler, the second in 1812 under Sir Wm. Gell; and the French
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>208</span>
&ldquo;Rothschild Expedition&rdquo; of 1873 under MM. O. Rayet and
A. Thomas sent a certain amount of architectural sculpture to
the Louvre. But no excavation was attempted till MM. E.
Pontremoli and B. Haussoullier were sent out by the French
Schools of Rome and Athens in 1895. They cleared the western
façade and the <i>prodomos</i>, and discovered inscriptions giving
information about other parts which they left still buried.
Finally the site was purchased by, and the French rights were
ceded to, Dr Th. Wiegand, the German explorer of Miletus, who
in 1905 began a thorough clearance of what is incomparably the
finest temple ruin in Asia Minor.</p>

<p>The temple was a decastyle peripteral structure of the Ionic
order, standing on seven steps and possessing double rows of outer
columns 60 ft. high, twenty-one in each row on the flanks. It
is remarkable not only for its great size, but (<i>inter alia</i>) for (1) the
rich ornament of its column bases, which show great variety of
design; (2) its various developments of the Ionic capital, <i>e.g.</i>
heads of gods, probably of Pergamene art, spring from the
&ldquo;eyes&rdquo; of the volutes with bulls&rsquo; heads between them; (3) the
massive building two storeys high at least, which served below
for <i>prodomos</i>, and above for a dispensary of oracles (<span class="grk" title="chrêsmographia">&#967;&#961;&#951;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#947;&#961;&#940;&#966;&#953;&#945;</span>
mentioned in the inscriptions) and a treasury; two flights of
stairs called &ldquo;labyrinths&rdquo; in the inscriptions, led up to these
chambers; (4) the pylon and staircase at the west; (5) the
frieze of Medusa heads and foliage. Two outer columns are still
erect on the north-east flank, carrying their entablature, and one
of the inner order stands on the south-west. The fact that the
temple was never finished is evident from the state in which some
bases still remain at the west. There were probably no pedimental
sculptures. A sacred way led from the temple to the sea
at Panormus, which was flanked with rows of archaic statues, ten
of which were excavated and sent to the British Museum in 1858
by C. T. Newton. Fragments of architectural monuments, which
once adorned this road, have also been found. Modern Hieronta
is a large and growing Greek village, the only settlement within a
radius of several miles. Its harbour is Kovella, distant about
2½ m., and on the N. of the promontory.</p>

the supposed element isolated by C. G. Mosander from cerite
(1839-1841). In 1879, however, Lecoq de Boisbaudran showed
that Mosander&rsquo;s &ldquo;didymium&rdquo; contained samarium; while the
residual &ldquo;didymium,&rdquo; after removal of samarium, was split
by Auer v. Welsbach (<i>Monats. f. Chemie</i>, 1885, 6, 477) into
two components (known respectively as neodymium and
praseodymium) by repeated fractional crystallization of the
double nitrate of ammonium and didymium in nitric acid.
<i>Neodymium</i> (Nd) forms the chief portion of the old &ldquo;didymium.&rdquo;
Its salts are reddish violet in colour, and give a characteristic
absorption spectrum. It forms oxides of composition Nd<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">3</span>

mass by the reduction of the peroxide. The salts of praseodymium
are green in colour, and give a characteristic spark spectrum.

Origen, though stoutly opposed to Arian and Macedonian teaching.
Such of his writings as survive show a remarkable knowledge

scholar and grammarian, flourished in the time of Cicero and
Augustus. His surname (Gr. <span class="grk" title="Chalkenteros">&#935;&#945;&#955;&#954;&#941;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>, brazen-bowelled)
came from his indefatigable industry; he was said to have
written so many books (more than 3500) that he was unable to
recollect their names (<span class="grk" title="bibliolathas">&#946;&#953;&#946;&#955;&#953;&#959;&#955;&#940;&#952;&#945;&#962;</span>). He lived and taught in
Alexandria and Rome, where he became the friend of Varro.
He is chiefly important as having introduced Alexandrian
learning to the Romans. He was a follower of the school of
Aristarchus, upon whose recension of Homer he wrote a treatise,
fragments of which have been preserved in the Venetian Scholia.
He also wrote commentaries on many other Greek poets and
prose authors. In his work on the lyric poets he treated of the
various classes of poetry and their chief representatives, and
his lists of words and phrases (used in tragedy and comedy
and by orators and historians), of words of doubtful meaning,
and of corrupt expressions, furnished the later grammarians with
valuable material. His activity extended to all kinds of subjects:
grammar (orthography, inflexions), proverbs, wonderful stories,
the law-tablets (<span class="grk" title="axones">&#7940;&#958;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#962;</span>) of Solon, stones, and different kinds of
wood. His polemic against Cicero&rsquo;s <i>De republica</i> (Ammianus
Marcellinus xxii. 16) provoked a reply from Suetonius. In spite
of his stupendous industry, Didymus was little more than a
compiler, of little critical judgment and doubtful accuracy, but
he deserves recognition for having incorporated in his numerous
writings the works of earlier critics and commentators.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIE,<a name="ar60" id="ar60"></a></span> a town of south-eastern France, capital of an arrondissement
in the department of Drôme, 43 m. E.S.E. of Valence on the
Paris-Lyon railway. Pop. (1906) 3090. The town is situated in a
plain enclosed by mountains on the right bank of the Drôme
below its confluence with the Meyrosse, which supplies power to
some of the industries. The most interesting structures of Die
are the old cathedral, with a porch of the 11th century supported
on granite columns from an ancient temple of Cybele; and the
Porte St Marcel, a Roman gateway flanked by massive towers.
The Roman remains also include the ruins of aqueducts and altars.
Die is the seat of a sub-prefect, and of a tribunal of first instance.
The manufactures are silk, furniture, cloth, lime and cement, and
there are flour and saw mills. Trade is in timber, especially
walnut, and in white wine known as <i>clairette de Die</i>. The mulberry
is largely grown for the rearing of silkworms. Under the Romans,
Die (<i>Dea Augusta Vocontiorum</i>) was an important colony. It was
formerly the seat of a bishopric, united to that of Valence from
1276 to 1687 and suppressed in 1790. Previous to the revocation
of the edict of Nantes in 1685 it had a Calvinistic university.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIE<a name="ar61" id="ar61"></a></span> (Fr. <i>dé</i>, from Lat. <i>datum</i>, given), a word used in various
senses, for a small cube of ivory, &amp;c. (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Dice</a></span>), for the engraved
stamps used in coining money, &amp;c., and various mechanical
appliances in engineering. In architecture a &ldquo;die&rdquo; is the term
used for the square base of a column, and it is applied also to
the vertical face of a pedestal or podium.</p>

<p>The fabrics known as &ldquo;dice&rdquo; take their name from the
rectangular form of the figure. The original figures would
probably be perfectly square, but to-day the same principle of
weaving is applied, and the name dice is given to all figures of
rectangular form. The different effects in the adjacent squares or
rectangles are due to precisely the same reasons as those explained
in connexion with the ground and the figure of damasks. The
same weaves are used in both damasks and dices, but simpler
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>209</span>
weaves are generally employed for the commoner classes of the
latter. The effect is, in every case, obtained by what are technically
called warp and weft float weaves. The illustration B shows
the two double damask weaves
arranged to form a dice pattern,
while A shows a similar
pattern made from two four-thread
twill weaves. C and D
represent respectively the disposition
of the threads in A
and B with the first pick,
and the solid marks represent
the floats of warp. The four
squares, which are almost as
pronounced in the cloth as
those of a chess-board, may
be made of any size by repeating
each weave for the amount
of surface required. It is only in the finest cloths that the double
damask weaves B are used for dice patterns, the single damask
weaves and the twill weaves being employed to a greater extent.
This class of pattern is largely employed for the production of
table-cloths of lower and medium qualities. The term damask
is also often applied to cloths of this character, and especially so
when the figure is formed by rectangles of different sizes.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIEBITSCH, HANS KARL FRIEDRICH ANTON,<a name="ar62" id="ar62"></a></span> count von
Diebitsch and Narden, called by the Russians Ivan Ivanovich,
Count Diebich-Zabalkansky (1785-1831), Russian field-marshal,
was born in Silesia on the 13th of May 1785. He was educated
at the Berlin cadet school, but by the desire of his father, a
Prussian officer who had passed into the service of Russia, he also
did the same in 1801. He served in the campaign of 1805, and
was wounded at Austerlitz, fought at Eylau and Friedland, and
after Friedland was promoted captain. During the next five
years of peace he devoted himself to the study of military science,
engaging once more in active service in the War of 1812. He
distinguished himself very greatly in Wittgenstein&rsquo;s campaign,
and in particular at Polotzk (October 18 and 19), after which
combat he was raised to the rank of major-general. In the latter
part of the campaign he served against the Prussian contingent
of General Yorck (von Wartenburg), with whom, through
Clausewitz, he negotiated the celebrated convention of Tauroggen,
serving thereafter with Yorck in the early part of the War of
Liberation. After the battle of Lützen he served in Silesia
and took part in negotiating the secret treaty of Reichenbach.
Having distinguished himself at the battles of Dresden and
Leipzig he was promoted lieutenant-general. At the crisis of
the campaign of 1814 he strongly urged the march of the allies on
Paris; and after their entry the emperor Alexander conferred on
him the order of St Alexander Nevsky. In 1815 he attended the
congress of Vienna, and was afterwards made adjutant-general
to the emperor, with whom, as also with his successor Nicholas,
he had great influence. By Nicholas he was created baron, and
later count. In 1820 he had become chief of the general staff,
and in 1825 he assisted in suppressing the St Petersburg <i>émeute</i>.
His greatest exploits were in the Russo-Turkish War of 1828-1829,
which, after a period of doubtful contest, was decided by
Diebitsch&rsquo;s brilliant campaign of Adrianople; this won him the
rank of field-marshal and the honorary title of Zabalkanski
to commemorate his crossing of the Balkans. In 1830 he was
appointed to command the great army destined to suppress the
insurrection in Poland. He won the terrible battle of Gróchow on
the 25th of February, and was again victorious at Ostrolenka on
the 26th of May, but soon afterwards he died of cholera (or by his
own hand) at Klecksewo near Pultusk, on the 10th of June 1831.</p>

Metz by rail. Pop. (1905) 6047. It is a railway junction of
some consequence, with cultivation of vines, fruit and vegetables,
brewing, tanning, &amp;c. Diedenhofen is an ancient Frank town
(Theudonevilla, Totonisvilla), in which imperial diets were held

<p><span class="bold">DIEKIRCH,<a name="ar64" id="ar64"></a></span> a small town in the grand duchy of Luxemburg,
charmingly situated on the banks of the Sûre. Pop. (1905)
3705. Its name is said to be derived from Dide or Dido, granddaughter
of Odin and niece of Thor. The mountain at the foot of
which the town lies, now called Herrenberg, was formerly known
as Thorenberg, or Thor&rsquo;s mountain. On the summit of this rock
rises a perennial stream which flows down into the town under the
name of Bellenflesschen. Diekirch was an important Roman
station, and in the 14th century John of Luxemburg, the blind
king of Bohemia, fortified it, surrounding the place with a
castellated wall and a ditch supplied by the stream mentioned.
It remained more <span class="correction" title="amended from for">or</span> less fortified until the beginning of the 19th
century when the French during their occupation levelled the old
walls, and substituted the avenues of trees that now encircle the
town. Diekirch is the administrative centre of one of the three
provincial divisions of the grand duchy. It is visited during the
summer by many thousand tourists and travellers from Holland,
Belgium and Germany.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIEMEN, ANTHONY VAN<a name="ar67" id="ar67"></a></span> (1593-1645), Dutch admiral and
governor-general of the East Indian settlements, was born at
Kuilenburg in 1593. He was educated in commerce, and on
entering the service of the East India Company speedily attained
high rank. In 1631 he led a Dutch fleet from the Indies to
Holland, and in 1636 he was raised to the governor-generalship.
He came into conflict with the Portuguese, and took their
possessions in Ceylon and Malacca from them. He greatly
extended the commercial relationships of the Dutch, opening up
trade with Tong-king, China and Japan. As an administrator
also he showed ability, and the foundation of a Latin school and
several churches in Batavia is to be ascribed to him. Exploring
expeditions were sent to Australia under his auspices in 1636 and
1642, and Abel Tasman named after him (Van Diemen&rsquo;s Land)
the island now called Tasmania. Van Diemen died at Batavia on
the 19th of April 1645.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DIEPENBECK, ABRAHAM VAN<a name="ar68" id="ar68"></a></span> (1599-1675), Flemish
painter, was born at Herzogenbusch, and studied painting at
Antwerp, where he became one of Rubens&rsquo;s &ldquo;hundred pupils.&rdquo;
But he was not one of the cleverest of Rubens&rsquo;s followers, and
he succeeded, at the best, in imitating the style and aping the
peculiarities of his master. We see this in his earliest pictures&mdash;a
portrait dated 1629 in the Munich Pinakothek, and a &ldquo;Distribution
of Alms&rdquo; of the same period in the same collection. Yet even
at this time there were moments when Diepenbeck probably
fancied that he might take another path. A solitary copperplate
executed with his own hand in 1630 represents a peasant sitting
under a tree holding the bridle of an ass, and this is a minute and
finished specimen of the engraver&rsquo;s art which shows that the
master might at one time have hoped to rival the animal draughtsmen
who flourished in the schools of Holland. However, large
commissions now poured in upon him; he was asked for altarpieces,
subject-pieces and pagan allegories. He was tempted to
try the profession of a glass-painter, and at last he gave up every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>210</span>
other occupation for the lucrative business of a draughtsman and
designer for engravings. Most of Diepenbeck&rsquo;s important canvases
are in continental galleries. The best are the &ldquo;Marriage of
St Catherine&rdquo; at Berlin and &ldquo;Mary with Angels Wailing over the
Dead Body of Christ&rdquo; in the Belvedere at Vienna, the first a very
fair specimen of the artist&rsquo;s skill, the second a picture of more
energy and feeling than might be expected from one who knew
more of the outer form than of the spirit of Rubens. Then we
have the fine &ldquo;Entombment&rdquo; at Brunswick, and &ldquo;St Francis Adoring
the Sacrament&rdquo; at the museum at Brussels, &ldquo;Clelia and her
Nymphs Flying from the Presence and Pursuit of Porsenna&rdquo; in
two examples at Berlin and Paris, and &ldquo;Neptune and Amphitrite&rdquo;
at Dresden. In all these compositions the drawing and execution
are after the fashion of Rubens, though inferior to Rubens in
harmony of tone and force of contrasted light and shade. Occasionally
a tendency may be observed to imitate the style of Vandyck,
for whom, in respect of pictures, Diepenbeck in his lifetime
was frequently taken. But Diepenbeck spent much less of his
leisure on canvases than on glass-painting. Though he failed to
master the secrets of gorgeous tinting, which were lost, apparently
for ever in the 16th century, he was constantly employed during
the best years of his life in that branch of his profession. In 1635
he finished forty scenes from the life of St Francis of Paula in the
church of the Minimes at Antwerp. In 1644 he received payment
for four windows in St Jacques of Antwerp, two of which are still
preserved, and represent Virgins to whom Christ appears after
the Resurrection. The windows ascribed to him at St Gudule
of Brussels were executed from the cartoons of Theodore van
Thulden. On the occasion of his matriculation at Antwerp in
1638-1639, Diepenbeck was registered in the guild of St Luke as a
glass-painter. He resigned his membership in the Artist Club of
the Violette in 1542, apparently because he felt hurt by a valuation
then made of drawings furnished for copperplates to the
engraver Pieter de Jode. The earliest record of his residence at
Antwerp is that of his election to the brotherhood (Sodalität)
&ldquo;of the Bachelors&rdquo; in 1634. It is probable that before this time
he had visited Rome and London, as noted in the work of
Houbraken. In 1636 he was made a burgess of Antwerp. He
married twice, in 1637 and 1652. He died in December 1675, and
was buried at St Jacques of Antwerp.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DIEPPE,<a name="ar69" id="ar69"></a></span> a seaport of northern France, capital of an arrondissement
in the department of Seine-Inférieure, on the English
Channel, 38 m. N. of Rouen, and 105 m. N.W. of Paris by the
Western railway. Pop. (1906) 22,120. It is situated at the
mouth of the river Arques in a valley bordered on each side
by steep white cliffs. The main part of the town lies to the west,
and the fishing suburb of Le Pollet to the east of the river and
harbour. The sea-front of Dieppe, which in summer attracts
large numbers of visitors, consists of a pebbly beach backed by a
handsome marine promenade. Dieppe has a modern aspect; its
streets are wide and its houses, in most cases, are built of brick.
Two squares side by side and immediately to the west of the outer
harbour form the nucleus of the town, the Place Nationale, overlooked
by the statue of Admiral A. Duquesne, and the Place St
Jacques, named after the beautiful Gothic church which stands
in its centre. The Grande Rue, the busiest and handsomest
street, leads westward from the Place Nationale. The church
of St Jacques was founded in the 13th century, but consists in
large measure of later workmanship and was in some portions
restored in the 19th century. The castle, overlooking the beach
from the summit of the western cliff, was erected in 1435. The
church of Notre-Dame de Bon Secours on the opposite cliff, and
the church of St Remy, of the 16th and 17th centuries, are other
noteworthy buildings. A well-equipped casino stands at the
west end of the sea-front. The public institutions include the subprefecture,
tribunals of first instance and commerce, a chamber
of commerce, a communal college and a school of navigation.</p>

<p>Dieppe has one of the safest and deepest harbours on the
English Channel. A curved passage cut in the bed of the Arques
and protected by an eastern and a western jetty gives access to
the outer harbour, which communicates at the east end by a lockgate
with the Bassin Duquesne and the Bassin Bérigny, and at
the west end by the New Channel, with an inner tidal harbour
and two other basins. Vessels drawing 20 ft. can enter the new
docks at neap tide. A dry-dock and a gridiron are included
among the repairing facilities of the port. The harbour railway
station is on the north-west quay of the outer harbour alongside
which the steamers from Newhaven lie. The distance of Dieppe
from Newhaven, with which there has long been daily communication,
is 64 m. The imports include silk and cotton goods, thread,
oil-seeds, timber, coal and mineral oil; leading exports are wine,
silk, woollen and cotton fabrics, vegetables and fruit and flint-pebbles.
The average annual value of imports for the five years
1901-1905 was £4,916,000 (£4,301,000 for the years 1896-1900);
the exports were valued at £9,206,000 (£7,023,000 for years
1896-1900). The industries comprise shipbuilding, cotton-spinning,
steam-sawing, the manufacture of machinery, porcelain,
briquettes, lace, and articles in ivory and bone, the production
of which dates from the 15th century. There is also a tobacco
factory of some importance. The fishermen of Le Pollet, to
whom tradition ascribes a Venetian origin, are among the main
providers of the Parisian market. The sea-bathing attracts
many visitors in the summer. Two miles to the north-east of
the town is the ancient camp known as the Cité de Limes, which
perhaps furnished the nucleus of the population of Dieppe.</p>

<p>It is suggested on the authority of its name, that Dieppe owed
its origin to a band of Norman adventurers, who found its &ldquo;diep&rdquo;
or inlet suitable for their ships, but it was unimportant till the
latter half of the 12th century. Its first castle was probably built
in 1188 by Henry II. of England, and it was counted a place of
some consideration when Philip Augustus attacked it in 1195.
By Richard I. of England it was bestowed in 1197 on the archbishop
of Rouen in return for certain territory in the neighbourhood
of the episcopal city. In 1339 it was plundered by the
English, but it soon recovered from the blow, and in spite of the
opposition of the lords of Hantot managed to surround itself with
fortifications. Its commercial activity was already great, and it
is believed that its seamen visited the coast of Guinea in 1339,
and founded there a Petit Dieppe in 1365. The town was
occupied by the English from 1420 to 1435. A siege undertaken
in 1442 by John Talbot, first earl of Shrewsbury, was raised by
the dauphin, afterwards Louis XI., and the day of the deliverance
continued for centuries to be celebrated by a great procession
and miracle plays. In the beginning of the 16th century Jean
Parmentier, a native of the town, made voyages to Brazil and
Sumatra; and a little later its merchant prince, Jacques Ango,
was able to blockade the Portuguese fleet in the Tagus. Francis
I. began improvements which were continued under his successor.
Its inhabitants in great number embraced the reformed religion;
and they were among the first to acknowledge Henry IV., who
fought one of his great battles at the neighbouring village of
Arques. Few of the cities of France suffered more from the
revocation of the edict of Nantes in 1685; and this blow was
followed in 1694 by a terrible bombardment on the part of the
English and Dutch. The town was rebuilt after the peace of
Ryswick, but the decrease of its population and the deterioration
of its port prevented the restoration of its commercial prosperity.
During the 19th century it made rapid advances, partly owing to
Marie Caroline, duchess of Berry, who brought it into fashion as a
watering-place; and also because the establishment of railway
communication with Paris gave an impetus to its trade. During
the Franco-German War the town was occupied by the Germans
from December 1870 till July 1871.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIES, CHRISTOPH ALBERT<a name="ar71" id="ar71"></a></span> (1755-1822), German painter,
was born at Hanover, and learned the rudiments of art in his
native place. For one year he studied in the academy of Dusseldorf,
and then he started at the age of twenty with thirty ducats
in his pocket for Rome. There he lived a frugal life till 1796.
Copying pictures, chiefly by Salvator Rosa, for a livelihood, his
taste led him to draw and paint from nature in Tivoli, Albano
and other picturesque places in the vicinity of Rome. Naples,
the birthplace of his favourite master, he visited more than once
for the same reasons. In this way he became a bold executant in
water-colours and in oil, though he failed to acquire any originality
of his own. Lord Bristol, who encouraged him as a copyist,
predicted that he would be a second Salvator Rosa. But Dies
was not of the wood which makes original artists. Besides other
disqualifications, he had necessities which forced him to give
up the great career of an independent painter. David, then
composing his Horatii at Rome, wished to take him to Paris.
But Dies had reasons for not accepting the offer. He was courting
a young Roman whom he subsequently married. Meanwhile he
had made the acquaintance of Volpato, for whom he executed
numerous drawings, and this no doubt suggested the plan, which
he afterwards carried out, of publishing, in partnership with
Méchan, Reinhardt and Frauenholz, the series of plates known
as the <i>Collection de vues pittoresques de l&rsquo;Italie</i>, published in
seventy-two sheets at Nuremberg in 1799. With so many
irons in the fire Dies naturally lost the power of concentration.
Other causes combined to affect his talent. In 1787 he swallowed
by mistake three-quarters of an ounce of sugar of lead. His recovery
from this poison was slow and incomplete. He settled at
Vienna, and lived there on the produce of his brush as a landscape
painter, and on that of his pencil or graver as a draughtsman and
etcher. But instead of getting better, his condition became
worse, and he even lost the use of one of his hands. In this
condition he turned from painting to music, and spent his leisure
hours in the pleasures of authorship. He did not long survive,
dying at Vienna in 1822, after long years of chronic suffering.
From two pictures now in the Belvedere gallery, and from
numerous engraved drawings from the neighbourhood of Tivoli,
we gather that Dies was never destined to rise above a respectable
mediocrity. He followed Salvator Rosa&rsquo;s example in imitating
the manner of Claude Lorraine. But Salvator adapted the style
of Claude, whilst Dies did no more than copy it.</p>

to the profession of teaching in 1811. In 1820 he was appointed
director of the new school at Mörs, where he put in practice the
methods of Pestalozzi. In 1832 he was summoned to Berlin to
direct the new state-schools seminary in that city. Here he
proved himself a strong supporter of unsectarian religious teaching.
In 1846 he established the Pestalozzi institution at Pankow,
and the Pestalozzi societies for the support of teachers&rsquo; widows

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DIET,<a name="ar74" id="ar74"></a></span> a term used in two senses, (1) food or the regulation
of feeding (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Dietary</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Dietetics</a></span>), (2) an assembly
or council (Fr. <i>diète</i>; It. <i>dieta</i>; Low Lat. <i>diaeta</i>; Ger. <i>Tag</i>).
We are here concerned only with this second sense. In
modern usage, though in Scotland the term is still sometimes
applied to any assembly or session, it is practically confined to
the sense of an assembly of estates or of national or federal
representatives. The origin of the word in this connotation is
somewhat complicated. It is undoubtedly ultimately derived
from the Greek <span class="grk" title="diaita">&#948;&#943;&#945;&#953;&#964;&#945;</span> (Lat. <i>diaeta</i>), which meant &ldquo;mode of
life&rdquo; and thence &ldquo;prescribed mode of life,&rdquo; the English &ldquo;diet&rdquo;
or &ldquo;regimen.&rdquo; This was connected with the verb <span class="grk" title="diaitan">&#948;&#953;&#945;&#953;&#964;&#8118;&#957;</span>, in
the sense of &ldquo;to rule,&rdquo; &ldquo;to regulate&rdquo;; compare the office of
<span class="grk" title="diaitêtês">&#948;&#953;&#945;&#953;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#942;&#962;</span> at Athens, and <i>dieteta</i>, &ldquo;umpire,&rdquo; in Late Latin.
In both Greek and Latin, too, the word meant &ldquo;a room,&rdquo; from
which the transition to &ldquo;a place of assembly&rdquo; and so to &ldquo;an
assembly&rdquo; would be easy. In the latter sense the word, however,
actually occurs only in Low Latin, Du Cange (<i>Glossarium</i>, <i>s.v.</i>)
deriving it from the late sense of &ldquo;meal&rdquo; or &ldquo;feast,&rdquo; the Germans
being accustomed to combine their political assemblies with
feasting. It is clear, too, that the word <i>diaeta</i> early became
confused with Lat. <i>dies</i>, &ldquo;day&rdquo; (Ger. <i>Tag</i>), &ldquo;especially a set
day, a day appointed for public business; whence, by extension,
meeting for business, an assembly&rdquo; (Skeat). Instances of this
confusion are given by Du Cange, <i>e.g.</i> <i>diaeta</i> for <i>dieta</i>, &ldquo;a day&rsquo;s
journey&rdquo; (also an obsolete sense of &ldquo;diet&rdquo; in English), and
<i>dieta</i> for &ldquo;the ordinary course of the church,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;the daily
office,&rdquo; which suggests the original sense of <i>diaeta</i> as &ldquo;a prescribed
mode of life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The word &ldquo;diet&rdquo; is now used in English for the <i>Reichstag</i>,
&ldquo;imperial diet&rdquo; of the old Holy Roman Empire; for the
<i>Bundestag</i>, &ldquo;federal diet,&rdquo; of the former Germanic confederation;
sometimes for the <i>Reichstag</i> of the modern German empire; for
the <i>Landtage</i>, &ldquo;territorial diets&rdquo; of the constituent states of the
German and Austrian empires; as well as for the former or
existing federal or national assemblies of Switzerland, Hungary,
Poland, &amp;c. Although, however, the word is still sometimes used
of all the above, the tendency is to confine it, so far as contemporary
assemblies are concerned, to those of subordinate
importance. Thus &ldquo;parliament&rdquo; is often used of the German
<i>Reichstag</i> or of the Russian Landtag, while the <i>Landtag</i>, <i>e.g.</i> of
Styria, would always be rendered &ldquo;diet.&rdquo; In what follows we
confine ourselves to the diet of the Holy Roman Empire and its
relation to its successors in modern Germany.</p>

<p>The origin of the diet, or deliberative assembly, of the Holy
Roman Empire must be sought in the <i>placitum</i> of the Frankish
empire. This represented the tribal assembly of the Franks,
meeting (originally in March, but after 755 in May, whence it is
called the Campus Maii) partly for a military review on the eve
of the summer campaign, partly for deliberation on important
matters of politics and justice. By the side of this larger
assembly, however, which contained in theory, if not in practice,
the whole body of Franks available for war, there had developed,
even before Carolingian times, a smaller body composed of the
magnates of the Empire, both lay and ecclesiastical. The germ
of this smaller body is to be found in the episcopal synods, which,
afforced by the attendance of lay magnates, came to be used
by the king for the settlement of national affairs. Under the
Carolingians it was usual to combine the assembly of magnates
with the <i>generalis conventus</i> of the &ldquo;field of May,&rdquo; and it was
in this inner assembly, rather than in the general body (whose
approval was merely formal, and confined to matters momentous
enough to be referred to a general vote), that the centre of power
really lay. It is from the assembly of magnates that the diet
of medieval Germany springs. The general assembly became
meaningless and unnecessary, as the feudal array gradually
superseded the old levy <i>en masse</i>, in which each freeman had
been liable to service; and after the close of the 10th century
it no longer existed.</p>

<p>The imperial diet (<i>Reichstag</i>) of the middle ages might sometimes
contain representatives of Italy, the <i>regnum Italicum</i>; but
it was practically always confined to the magnates of Germany,
the <i>regnum Teutonicum</i>. Upon occasion a summons to the diet
might be sent even to the knights, but the regular members were
the princes (<i>Fürsten</i>), both lay and ecclesiastical. In the 13th
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>212</span>
century the seven electors began to disengage themselves from
the prince as a separate element, and the Golden Bull (1356)
made their separation complete; from the 14th century onwards
the nobles (both counts and other lords) are regarded as regular
members; while after 1250 the imperial and episcopal towns
often appear through their representatives. By the 14th century,
therefore, the originally homogeneous diet of princes is already,
at any rate practically if not yet in legal form, divided into three
colleges&mdash;the electors, the princes and nobles, and the representatives
of the towns (though, as we shall see, the latter can
hardly be reckoned as regular members until the century of the
Reformation). Under the Hohenstaufen it is still the rule that
every member of the diet must attend personally, or lose his vote;
at a later date the principle of representation by proxy, which
eventually made the diet into a mere congress of envoys, was
introduced. By the end of the 13th century the vote of the
majority had come to be regarded as decisive; but in accordance
with the strong sense of social distinctions which marks German
history, the quality as well as the quantity of votes was weighed,
and if the most powerful of the princes were agreed, the opinion
of the lesser magnates was not consulted. The powers of the
medieval diet extended to matters like legislation, the decision
upon expeditions (especially the <i>expeditio Romana</i>), taxation and
changes in the constitution of the principalities or the Empire.
The election of the king, which was originally regarded as one of
the powers of the diet, had passed to the electors by the middle
of the 13th century.</p>

<p>A new era in the history of the diet begins with the Reformation.
The division of the diet into three colleges becomes definite
and precise; the right of the electors, for instance, to constitute
a separate college is explicitly recognized as a matter of established
custom in 1544. The representatives of the towns now become
regular members. In the 15th century they had only attended
when special business, such as imperial reform or taxation, fell
under discussion; in 1500, however, they were recognized as a
separate and regular estate, though it was not until 1648 that
they were recognized as equal to the other estates of the diet.
The estate of the towns, or college of municipal representatives,
was divided into two benches, the Rhenish and the Swabian.
The estate of the princes and counts, which stood midway
between the electors and the towns, also attained, in the years
that followed the Reformation, its final organization. The vote
of the great princes ceased to be personal, and began to be
territorial. This had two results. The division of a single
territory among the different sons of a family no longer, as of old,
multiplied the voting power of the family; while in the opposite
case, the union of various territories in the hands of a single
person no longer meant the extinction of several votes, since the
new owner was now allowed to give a vote for each of his territories.
The position of the counts and other lords, who joined
with the princes in forming the middle estate, was finally fixed
by the middle of the 17th century. While each of the princes
enjoyed an individual vote, the counts and other lords were
arranged in groups, each of which voted as a whole, though the
whole of its vote (<i>Kuriatstimme</i>) only counted as equal to the
vote of a single prince (<i>Virilstimme</i>). There were six of these
groups; but as the votes of the whole college of princes and
counts (at any rate in the 18th century) numbered 100, they
could exercise but little weight.</p>

<p>The last era in the history of the diet may be said to open with
the treaty of Westphalia (1648). The treaty acknowledged that
Germany was no longer a unitary state, but a loose confederation
of sovereign princes; and the diet accordingly ceased to bear the
character of a national assembly, and became a mere congress of
envoys. The &ldquo;last diet&rdquo; which issued a regular recess (<i>Reichsabschied</i>&mdash;the
term applied to the <i>acta</i> of the diet, as formally
compiled and enunciated at its dissolution) was that of Regensburg
in 1654. The next diet, which met at Regensburg in 1663,
never issued a recess, and was never dissolved; it continued in
permanent session, as it were, till the dissolution of the Empire
in 1806. This result was achieved by the process of turning the
diet from an assembly of principals into a congress of envoys.
The emperor was represented by two <i>commissarii</i>; the electors,
princes and towns were similarly represented by their accredited
agents. Some legislation was occasionally done by this body; a
<i>conclusum imperii</i> (so called in distinction from the old <i>recessus
imperii</i> of the period before 1663) might slowly (very slowly&mdash;for
the agents, imperfectly instructed, had constantly to refer
matters back to their principals) be achieved; but it rested with
the various princes to promulgate and enforce the <i>conclusum</i> in
their territories, and they were sufficiently occupied in issuing
and enforcing their own decrees. In practice the diet had
nothing to do; and its members occupied themselves in
&ldquo;wrangling about chairs&rdquo;&mdash;that is to say, in unending disputes
about degrees and precedences.</p>

<p>In the Germanic Confederation, which occupies the interval
between the death of the Holy Roman Empire and the formation
of the North German Confederation (1815-1866), a diet
(<i>Bundestag</i>) existed, which was modelled on the old diet of the 18th
century. It was a standing congress of envoys at Frankfort-on-Main.
Austria presided in the diet, which, in the earlier years of
its history, served, under the influence of Metternich, as an organ
for the suppression of Liberal opinion. In the North German
Confederation (1867-1870) a new departure was made, which has
been followed in the constitution of the present German empire.
Two bodies were instituted&mdash;a <i>Bundesrat</i>, which resembles the old
diet in being a congress of envoys sent by the sovereigns of the
different states of the confederation, and a <i>Reichstag</i>, which bears
the name of the old diet, but differs entirely in composition. The
new Reichstag is a popular representative assembly, based on
wide suffrage and elected by ballot; and, above all, it is an
assembly representing, not the several states, but the whole
Empire, which is divided for this purpose into electoral districts.
Both as a popular assembly, and as an assembly which represents
the whole of a united Germany, the new Reichstag goes back, one
may almost say, beyond the diet even of the middle ages, to the
days of the old Teutonic folk-moot.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIETARY,<a name="ar75" id="ar75"></a></span> in a general sense, a system or course of diet, in the
sense of food; more particularly, such an allowance and regulation
of food as that supplied to workhouses, the army and navy,
prisons, &amp;c. Lowest in the scale of such dietaries comes what
is termed &ldquo;bare existence&rdquo; diet, administered to certain classes
of the community who have a claim on their fellow-countrymen
that their lives and health shall be preserved <i>in statu quo</i>, but
nothing further. This applies particularly to the members of
a temporarily famine-stricken community. Before the days of
prison reform, too, the dietary scale of many prisons was to
a certain extent penal, in that the food supplied to prisoners
was barely sufficient for existence. Nowadays more humane
principles apply; there is no longer the obvious injustice of
applying the same scale of quantity and quality to all prisoners
under varying circumstances of constitution and surroundings,
and whether serving long or short periods of imprisonment.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The system of dietary in force in the local and convict prisons of
England and Wales is that recommended by the Home Office on the
advice of a departmental committee. As to the local prison dietary,
its application is based on (1) the principle of variation of diet with
length of sentence; (2) the system of progressive dietary; (3) the
distinction between hard labour diets and non-hard labour diets;
(4) the differentiation of diet according to age and sex. There are
three classes of diet, classes A, B and C. Class A diet is given
to prisoners undergoing not more than seven days&rsquo; imprisonment.
The food is good and wholesome, but sufficiently plain and unattractive,
so as not to offer temptation to the loafer or mendicant.
It is given in quantity sufficient to maintain health and strength
during the single week. Prisoners sentenced to more than seven days
and not more than fourteen days are given class A diet for the first
seven days and class B for the remainder of the sentence. In most
of the local prisons in England and Wales prisoners sentenced to
hard labour received hard labour diet, although quite 60% were
unable to perform the hardest forms of prison labour either through
physical defect, age or infirmity. The departmental committee
of 1899 in their report recommended that no distinction should be
made between hard labour and non-hard labour diets. Class A diet
is as follows:&mdash;<i>Breakfast</i>, Bread, 8 oz. daily (6 oz. for women and
juveniles) with 1 pint of gruel. Juveniles (males and females under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>213</span>
sixteen years of age) get, in addition, ½ pint of milk. <i>Dinner</i>, 8 oz. of
bread daily, with 1 pint of porridge on three days of the week, 8 oz.
of potatoes (representing the vegetable element) on two other days,
and 8 oz. of suet pudding (representing the fatty element) on the
other two days. <i>Supper</i>, the breakfast fare repeated.</p>

<p>Class B diet, which is also given to (1) prisoners on remand or
awaiting trial, (2) offenders of the 1st division who do not maintain
themselves, (3) offenders of the 2nd division and (4) debtors, is as
shown in Table I.</p>

<p>Class C diet is class B amplified, and is given to those prisoners
serving sentences of three months and over.</p>

<p>The dietary of convict prisons, in which prisoners are all under long
sentence, is divided into a diet for convicts employed at hard labour
and a diet for convicts employed at sedentary, indoor and light
labour. It will be found set forth in the Blue-book mentioned above.
The sparest of all prison diets is called &ldquo;punishment diet,&rdquo; and is
administered for offences against the internal discipline of the prison.
It is limited to a period of three days. It consists of 1 &#8468; of bread
and as much water as the prisoner chooses to drink.</p>

<p>In French prisons the dietary is nearly two pounds weight of bread,
with two meals of thin soup (breakfast and dinner) made from
potatoes, beans or other vegetables, and on two days a week made
from meat. In France the canteen system is in vogue, additional
food, such as sausages, cheese, fruit, &amp;c., may be obtained by the
prisoner, according to the wages he receives for his labours. The
dietary of Austrian prisons is 1½ &#8468; of bread daily, a dinner of soup
on four days of the week, and of meat on the other three days,
with a supper of soup or vegetable stew. Additional food can be
purchased by the prisoner out of his earnings.</p>

<p>These dietaries may be taken as more or less typical of the ordinary
prison fare in most civilized countries, though in some countries it
may err on the side of severity, as in Sweden, prisoners being given
only two meals a day, one at mid-day and one at seven p.m., porridge
or gruel being the principal element in both meals. On the other
hand, the prison dietaries of many of the United States prisons go
to the other extreme, fresh fish, green vegetables, even coffee and
fruit, figuring in the dietary.</p>

<p>Another class of dietary is that given to paupers. In England,
until 1900, almost every individual workhouse had its own special
dietary, with the consequence that many erred on the side of scantiness
and unsuitability, while others were too lavish. By an order of
the Local Government Board of that year, acting on a report of a
committee, all inmates of workhouses, with the exception of the sick,
children under three years of age, and certain other special cases,
are dieted in accordance with certain dietary tables as framed and
settled by the board. The order contained a great number of different
rations, it being left to the discretion of the guardians as to the final
settlement of the tables. For adult inmates the dietary tables are
for each sex respectively, two in number, one termed &ldquo;plain diet&rdquo;
and the other &ldquo;infirm diet.&rdquo; All male inmates certified as healthy
able-bodied persons receive plain diet only. All inmates, however,
in workhouses are kept employed according to their capacity and
ability, and this is taken into consideration in giving allowances of
food. For instance, for work with sustained exertion, such as stone-breaking,
digging, &amp;c., more food is given than for work without
sustained exertion, such as wood-chopping, weeding or sewing.
Table II. shows an example of a workhouse dietary.</p>

<p>In the casual wards of workhouses the dietary is plainer, consisting
of 8 oz. of bread, or 6 oz. of bread and one pint of gruel or broth for
breakfast; the same for supper; for dinner 8 oz. of bread and 1½ oz.
of cheese or 6 oz. of bread and one pint of soup. The American poor
law system is based broadly on that of England, and the methods
of relief are much the same. Each state, however, makes its own
regulations, and there is considerable diversity in workhouse dietaries
in consequence. The German system of poor relief is more methodical
than those of England and America. The really deserving are treated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>214</span>
with more commiseration, and a larger amount of outdoor relief is
given than in England. There is no casual ward, tramps and beggars
being liable to penal treatment, but there are &ldquo;relief stations,&rdquo;
somewhat corresponding to casual wards, where destitute persons
tramping from one place to another can obtain food and lodging in
return for work done.</p>

<p>In the British navy certain staple articles of diet are supplied to
the men to the value approximately of 6d. per diem&mdash;the standard
government ration&mdash;and, in addition, a messing allowance of 4d. per
diem, which may either be expended on luxuries in the canteen, or
in taking up government provisions on board ship, in addition to
the standard ration. The standard ration as recommended in 1907

<p>In the British army the soldier is fed partly by a system of co-operation.
He gets a free ration from government of 1 &#8468; of bread and
¾ &#8468; of meat; in addition there is a messing allowance of 3½d. per
man per day. He is able to supplement his food by purchases from
the canteen. Much depends on the individual management in each
regiment as to the satisfactory expenditure of the messing allowance.
In some regiments an allowance is made from the canteen funds
towards messing in addition to that granted by the government.
The ordinary <i>field</i> ration of the British soldier is 1½ &#8468; of bread or
1 &#8468; of biscuit; 1 &#8468; of fresh, salt or preserved meat; ½ oz. of coffee;
1/6 oz. of tea; 2 oz. of sugar; ½ oz. of salt, <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">36</span> oz. of pepper, the
whole weighing something over 2 &#8468; 3 oz. This cannot be looked
on as a fixed ration, as it varies in different campaigns, according to
the country into which the troops may be sent. The Prussian soldier
during peace gets weekly from his canteen 11 &#8468; 1 oz. of rye bread
and not quite 2½ &#8468; of meat. This is obviously insufficient, but under</p>

<p>the conscription system it is reckoned that he will be able to make
up the deficiency out of his own private means, or obtain charitable
contributions from his friends. In the French infantry of the line
each man during peace gets weekly 15 &#8468; of bread, 3<span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">10</span> &#8468; of meat,
2½ &#8468; of haricot beans or other vegetables, with salt and pepper, and

<p><span class="bold">DIETETICS,<a name="ar76" id="ar76"></a></span> the science of diet, <i>i.e.</i> the food and nutrition of
man in health and disease (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Nutrition</a></span>). This article deals
mainly with that part of the subject which has to do with the
composition and nutritive values of foods and their adaptation
to the use of people in health. The principal topics considered
are: (1) Food and its functions; (2) Metabolism of matter and
energy; (3) Composition of food materials; (4) Digestibility of
food; (5) Fuel value of food; (6) Food consumption; (7) Quantities
of nutrients needed; (8) Hygienic economy of food; (9)
Pecuniary economy of food.</p>

<p>1. <i>Food and its Functions.</i>&mdash;For practical purposes, food may be
defined as that which, when taken into the body, may be utilized
for the formation and repair of body tissue, and the production
of energy. More specifically, food meets the requirements of the
body in several ways. It is used for the formation of the tissues
and fluids of the body, and for the restoration of losses of substance
due to bodily activity. The potential energy of the food
is converted into heat or muscular work or other forms of energy.
In being thus utilized, food protects body substance or previously
acquired nutritive material from consumption. When the amount
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>215</span>
of food taken into the body is in excess of immediate needs, the
surplus may be stored for future consumption.</p>

<p>Ordinary food materials, such as meat, fish, eggs, vegetables,
&amp;c., consist of inedible materials, or <i>refuse</i>, <i>e.g.</i> bone of meat
and fish, shell of eggs, rind and seed of vegetables; and <i>edible
material</i>, as flesh of meat and fish, white and yolk of eggs, wheat
flour, &amp;c. The edible material is by no means a simple substance,
but consists of <i>water</i>, and some or all of the compounds
variously designated as food stuffs, proximate principles, nutritive
ingredients or nutrients, which are classified as <i>protein</i>, <i>fats</i>,
<i>carbohydrates</i> and <i>mineral matters</i>. These have various functions
in the nourishment of the body.</p>

<p>The <i>refuse</i> commonly contains compounds similar to those
in the food from which it is derived, but since it cannot be eaten,
it is usually considered as a non-nutrient. It is of importance
chiefly in a consideration of the pecuniary economy of food.
<i>Water</i> is also considered as a non-nutrient, because although it is a
constituent of all the tissues and fluids of the body, the body may
obtain the water it needs from that drunk; hence, that contained
in the food materials is of no special significance as a nutrient.</p>

<p><i>Mineral matters</i>, such as sulphates, chlorides, phosphates and
carbonates of sodium, potassium, calcium, &amp;c., are found in
different combinations and quantities in most food materials.
These are used by the body in the formation of the various
tissues, especially the skeletal and protective tissues, in digestion,
and in metabolic processes within the body. They yield little
or no energy, unless perhaps the very small amount involved in
their chemical transformation.</p>

<p>Protein<a name="fa1f" id="fa1f" href="#ft1f"><span class="sp">1</span></a> is a term used to designate the whole group of
nitrogenous compounds of food except the nitrogenous fats. It
includes the albuminoids, as albumin of egg-white, and of blood
serum, myosin of meat (muscle), casein of milk, globulin of blood
and of egg yolk, fibrin of blood, gluten of flour; the gelatinoids,
as gelatin and allied substances of connective tissue, collagen of
tendon, ossein of bone and the so-called extractives (<i>e.g.</i> creatin)
of meats; and the amids (<i>e.g.</i> asparagin) and allied compounds of
vegetables and fruits.</p>

<p>The albuminoids and gelatinoids, classed together as proteids,
are the most important constituents of food, because they alone
can supply the nitrogenous material necessary for the formation
of the body tissues. For this purpose, the albuminoids are most
valuable. Both groups of compounds, however, supply the body
with energy, and the gelatinoids in being thus utilized protect
the albuminoids from consumption for this purpose. When their
supply in the food is in excess of the needs of the body, the surplus
proteids may be converted into body fat and stored.</p>

<p>The so-called extractives, which are the principal constituents
of meat extract, beef tea and the like, act principally as stimulants
and appetizers. It has been believed that they serve neither
to build tissue nor to yield energy, but recent investigations<a name="fa2f" id="fa2f" href="#ft2f"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
indicate that creatin may be metabolized in the body.</p>

<p>The <i>fats</i> of food include both the animal fats and the vegetable
oils. The <i>carbohydrates</i> include such compounds as starches,
sugars and the fibre of plants or cellulose, though the latter has
but little value as food for man. The more important function
of both these classes of nutrients is to supply energy to the body
to meet its requirements above that which it may obtain from the
proteids. It is not improbable that the atoms of their molecules
as well as those from the proteids are built up into the protoplasmic
substance of the tissues. In this sense, these nutrients
may be considered as being utilized also for the formation of
tissue; but they are rather the accessory ingredients, whereas the
proteids are the essential ingredients for this purpose. The fats
in the food in excess of the body requirements may be stored as
body fat, and the surplus carbohydrates may also be converted
into fat and stored.</p>

<p>To a certain extent, then, the nutrients of the food may
substitute each other. All may be incorporated into the protoplasmic
structure of body tissue, though only the proteids can
supply the essential nitrogenous ingredients; and apart from
the portion of the proteid material that is indispensable for this
purpose, all the nutrients are used as a source of energy. If the
supply of energy in the food is not sufficient, the body will use
its own proteid and fat for this purpose. The gelatinoids, fats
and carbohydrates in being utilized for energy protect the body
proteids from consumption. The fat stored in the body from the
excess of food is a reserve of energy material, on which the body
may draw when the quantity of energy in the food is insufficient
for its immediate needs.</p>

<p>What compounds are especially concerned in intellectual
activity is not known. The belief that fish is especially rich in
phosphorus and valuable as a brain food has no foundation in
observed fact.</p>

<p>2. <i>Metabolism of Matter and Energy.</i>&mdash;The processes of nutrition
thus consist largely of the transformation of food into body
material and the conversion of the potential energy of both food
and body material into the kinetic energy of heat and muscular
work and other forms of energy. These various processes are
generally designated by the term metabolism. The metabolism
of matter in the body is governed largely by the needs of the body
for energy. The science of nutrition, of which the present subject
forms a part, is based on the principle that the transformations
of matter and energy in the body occur in accordance with the
laws of the conservation of matter and of energy. That the body
can neither create nor destroy matter has long been universally
accepted. It would seem that the transformation of energy must
likewise be governed by the law of the conservation of energy;
indeed there is every reason a priori to believe that it must; but
the experimental difficulties in the way of absolute demonstration
of the principle are considerable. For such demonstration it is
necessary to prove that the income and expenditure of energy
are equal. Apparatus and methods of inquiry devised in recent
years, however, afford means for a comparison of the amounts of
both matter and energy received and expended by the body, and
from the results obtained in a large amount of such research,
it seems probable that the law obtains in the living organism in
general.</p>

<p>The first attempt at such demonstration was made by
M. Rubner<a name="fa3f" id="fa3f" href="#ft3f"><span class="sp">3</span></a> in 1894, experimenting with dogs doing no external
muscular work. The income of energy (as heat) was computed,
but the heat eliminated was measured. In the average of eight
experiments continuing forty-five days, the two quantities agreed
within 0.47%, thus demonstrating what it was desired to prove&mdash;that
the heat given off by the body came solely from the
oxidation of food within it. Results in accordance with these
were reported by Studenski<a name="fa4f" id="fa4f" href="#ft4f"><span class="sp">4</span></a> in 1897, and by Laulanie<a name="fa5f" id="fa5f" href="#ft5f"><span class="sp">5</span></a> in 1898.</p>

<p>The most extensive and complete data yet available on the
subject have been obtained by W. O. Atwater, F. G. Benedict and
associates<a name="fa6f" id="fa6f" href="#ft6f"><span class="sp">6</span></a> in experiments with men in the respiration calorimeter,
in which a subject may remain for several consecutive days
and nights. These experiments involve actual weighing and
analyses of the food and drink, and of the gaseous, liquid and
solid excretory products; determinations of potential energy
(heat of oxidation) of the oxidizable material received and given
off by the body (including estimation of the energy of the material
gained or lost by the body); and measurements of the amounts of
energy expended as heat and as external muscular work. By
October 1906 eighty-eight experiments with fifteen different subjects
had been completed. The separate experiments continued
from two to thirteen days, making a total of over 270 days.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>216</span>
In some cases the subjects were at rest; in others they performed
varying amounts of external muscular work on an
apparatus by means of which the amount of work done was
measured. In some cases they fasted, and in others they received
diets generally not far from sufficient to maintain nitrogen, and
usually carbon, equilibrium in the body. In these experiments
the amount of energy expended by the body as heat and as
external muscular work measured in terms of heat agreed on
the average very closely with the amount of heat that would be
produced by the oxidation of all the matter metabolized in the
body. The variations for individual days, and in the average for
individual experiments as well, were in some cases appreciable,
amounting to as much as 6%, which is not strange in view of the
uncertainties in physiological experimenting; but in the average
of all the experiments the energy of the expenditure was above
99.9% of the energy of the income,&mdash;an agreement within one
part in 1000. While these results do not absolutely prove the
application of the law of the conservation of energy in the human
body, they certainly approximate very closely to such demonstration.
It is of course possible that energy may have given off
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>217</span>
from the body in other forms than heat and external muscular
work. It is conceivable, for example, that intellectual activity
may involve the transformation of physical energy, and that the
energy involved may be eliminated in some form now unknown.
But if the body did give off energy which was not measured in
these experiments, the quantity must have been extremely small.
It seems fair to infer from the results obtained that the metabolism
of energy in the body occurred in conformity with the law
of the conservation of energy.</p>

<p>3. <i>Composition of Food Materials.</i>&mdash;The composition of food
is determined by chemical analyses, the results of which are
conventionally expressed in terms of the nutritive ingredients
previously described. As a result of an enormous amount of
such investigation in recent years, the kinds and proportions of
nutrients in our common sorts of food are well known. Average
values for percentage composition of some ordinary food materials
are shown in Table I. (Table I. also includes figures for fuel
value.)</p>

<p>It will be observed that different kinds of food materials vary
widely in their proportions of nutrients. In general the animal
foods contain the most protein and fats, and vegetable foods are
rich in carbohydrates. The chief nutrient of lean meat and fish is
protein; but in medium fat meats the proportion of fat is as large
as that of protein, and in the fatter meats it is larger. Cheese
is rich in both protein and fat. Among the vegetable foods, dried
beans and peas are especially rich in protein. The proportion in
oatmeal is also fairly large, in wheat it is moderate, and in maize
meal and rice it is rather small. Oats contain more oil than any
of the common cereals, but in none of them is the proportion
especially large. The most abundant nutrient in all the cereals is
starch, which comprises from two-thirds to three-fourths or more
of their total nutritive substance. Cotton-seed is rich in edible
oil, and so are olives. Some of the nuts contain fairly large
proportions of both protein and fat. The nutrient of potatoes is
starch, present in fair proportion. Fruits contain considerable
carbohydrates, chiefly sugar. Green vegetables are not of much
account as sources of any of the nutrients or energy.</p>

<p>Similar food materials from different sources may also differ
considerably in composition. This is especially true of meats.
Thus, the leaner portions from a fat animal may contain nearly as
much fat as the fatter portions from a lean animal. The data
here presented are largely those for American food products,
but the available analyses of English food materials indicate
that the latter differ but little from the former in composition.
The analyses of meats produced in Europe imply that they
commonly contain somewhat less fat and more water, and
often more protein, than American meats. The meats of English
production compare with the American more than with the
European meats. Similar vegetable foods from the different
countries do not differ so much in composition.</p>

<p>4. <i>Digestibility or Availability of Food Materials.</i>&mdash;The value
of any food material for nutriment depends not merely upon the
kinds and amounts of nutrients it contains, but also upon the
ease and convenience with which the nutrients may be digested,
and especially upon the proportion of the nutrients that will be
actually digested and absorbed. Thus, two foods may contain
equal amounts of the same nutrient, but the one most easily
digested will really be of most value to the body, because less
effort is necessary to utilize it. Considerable study of this factor
is being made, and much valuable information is accumulating,
but it is of more especial importance in cases of disordered
digestion.</p>

<p>The digestibility of food in the sense of thoroughness of
digestion, however, is of particular importance in the present
discussion. Only that portion of the food that is digested
and absorbed is available to the body for the building of tissue
and the production of energy. Not all the food eaten is thus
actually digested; undigested material is excreted in the faeces.
The thoroughness of digestion is determined experimentally by
weighing and analysing the food eaten and the faeces pertaining
to it. The difference between the corresponding ingredients of
the two is commonly considered to represent the amounts of
the ingredients digested. Expressed in percentages, these are
called coefficients of digestibility. See Table II.</p>

<p>Such a method is not strictly accurate, because the faeces do
not consist entirely of undigested food but contain in addition
to this the so-called metabolic products, which include the residuum
of digestive juices not resorbed, fragments of intestinal
epithelium, &amp;c. Since there is as yet no satisfactory method of
separating these constituents of the excreta, the actual digestibility
of the food is not determined. It has been suggested that
since these materials must originally come from food, they
represent, when expressed in terms of food ingredients, the cost of
digestion; hence that the values determined as above explained
represent the portion of food available to the body for the building
of tissue and the yielding of energy, and what is commonly
designated as digestibility should be called availability. Other
writers retain the term &ldquo;digestibility,&rdquo; but express the results
as &ldquo;apparent digestibility,&rdquo; until more knowledge regarding
the metabolic products of the excreta is available and the actual
digestibility may be ascertained.</p>

<p>Experimental inquiry of this nature has been very active in
recent years, especially in Europe, the United States and Japan;
and the results of considerably over 1000 digestion experiments
with single foods or combinations of food materials are available.
These were mostly with men, but some were with women
and with children. The larger part of these have been taken
into account in the following estimations of the digestibility
of the nutrients in different classes of food materials. The
figures here shown are subject to revision as experimental data
accumulate. They are not to be taken as exact measures of
the digestibility (or availability) of every kind of food in each
given class, but they probably represent fairly well the average
digestibility of the classes of food materials as ordinarily utilized
in the mixed diet.</p>

<p>5. <i>Fuel Value of Food.</i>&mdash;The potential energy of food is
commonly measured as the amount of heat evolved when the
food is completely oxidized. In the laboratory this is determined
by burning the food in oxygen in a calorimeter. The results,
which are known as the heat of combustion of the food, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>218</span>
expressed in calories, one calory being the amount of heat
necessary to raise the temperature of one kilogram of water one
degree centigrade. But it is to be observed that this unit is
employed simply from convenience, and without implication
as to what extent the energy of food is converted into heat in
the body. The unit employed in the measurement of some other
form of energy might be used instead, as, for example, the foot-ton,
which represents the amount of energy necessary to raise
one ton through one foot.</p>

<p>The amount of energy which a given quantity of food will
produce on complete oxidation outside the body, however, is
greater than that which the body will actually derive from it.
In the first place, as previously shown, part of the food will not
be digested and absorbed. In the second place, the nitrogenous
compounds absorbed are not completely oxidized in the body,
the residuum being excreted in the urine as urea and other bodies
that are capable of further oxidation in the calorimeter. The
total heat of combustion of the food eaten must therefore be
diminished by the heat of combustion of the oxidizable material
rejected by the body, to find what amount of energy is actually
available to the organism for the production of work and heat.
The amount thus determined is commonly known as the fuel
value of food.</p>

<p>Rubner&rsquo;s<a name="fa7f" id="fa7f" href="#ft7f"><span class="sp">7</span></a> commonly quoted estimates for the fuel value of the
nutrients of mixed diet are,&mdash;for protein and carbohydrates 4.1,
and for fats 9.3 calories per gram. According to the method of
deduction, however, these factors were more applicable to digested
than to total nutrients. Atwater<a name="fa8f" id="fa8f" href="#ft8f"><span class="sp">8</span></a> and associates have deduced,
from data much more extensive than those available to Rubner,
factors for total nutrients somewhat lower than these, as shown
in Table III. These estimates seem to represent the best
average factors at present available, but are subject to revision
as knowledge is extended.</p>

<p>The heats of combustion of all the fats in an ordinary mixed
diet would average about 9.40 calories per gram, but as only
95% of the fat would be available to the body, the fuel value
per gram would be (9.40 × 0.95 =) 8.93 calories. Similarly, the
average heat of combustion of carbohydrates of the diet would be
about 4.15 calories per gram, and as 97% of the total quantity
is available to the body, the fuel value per gram would be 4.03.
(It is commonly assumed that the resorbed fats and carbohydrates
are completely oxidized in the body.) The heats of
combustion of all the kinds of protein in the diet would average
about 5.65 calories per gram. Since about 92% of the total
protein would be available to the body, the potential energy of
the available protein would be equivalent to (5.65 × 0.92 =) 5.20
calories; but as the available protein is not completely oxidized
allowance must be made for the potential energy of the incompletely
oxidized residue. This is estimated as equivalent to 1.15
calories for the 0.92 gram of available protein; hence, the fuel
value of the total protein is (5.20 &minus; 1.15 =) 4.05 calories per gram.
Nutrients of the same class, but from different food materials,
vary both in digestibility and in heat of combustion, and hence
in fuel value. These factors are therefore not so applicable to the
nutrients of the separate articles in a diet as to those of the diet as
a whole.</p>

<p>6. <i>Food Consumption.</i>&mdash;Much information regarding the food
consumption of people in various circumstances in different parts
of the world has accumulated during the past twenty years, as a
result of studies of actual dietaries in England, Germany, Italy,
Russia, Sweden and elsewhere in Europe, in Japan and other
oriental countries, and especially in the United States. These
studies commonly consist in ascertaining the kinds, amounts
and composition of the different food materials consumed by a
group of persons during a given period and the number of meals
taken by each member of the group, and computing the quantities
of the different nutrients in the food on the basis of one man for
one day. When the members of the group are of different age,
sex, occupation, &amp;c., account must be taken of the effect of these
factors on consumption in estimating the value &ldquo;per man.&rdquo;
Men as a rule eat more than women under similar conditions,
women more than children, and persons at active work more than
those at sedentary occupation. The navvy, for example, who
is constantly using up more nutritive material or body tissue to
supply the energy required for his muscular work needs more
protein and energy in his food than a bookkeeper who sits at his
desk all day.</p>

<p>In making allowance for these differences, the various individuals
are commonly compared with a man at moderately active
muscular work, who is taken as unity. A man at hard muscular
work is reckoned at 1.2 times such an individual; a man with
light muscular work or a boy 15-16 years old, .9; a man at
sedentary occupation, woman at moderately active muscular
work, boy 13-14 or girl 15-16 years old, .8; woman at light work,
boy 12 or girl 13-14 years old, .7; boy 10-11 or girl 10-12
years old, .6; child 6-9 years old, .5; child 2-5 years old, .4;
child under 2 years, .3. These factors are by no means absolute
or final, but are based in part upon experimental data and in
part upon arbitrary assumption.</p>

<p>The total number of dietary studies on record is very large,
but not all of them are complete enough to furnish reliable
data. Upwards of 1000 are sufficiently accurate to be included
in statistical averages of food consumed by people in different
circumstances, nearly half of which have been made in the United
States in the past decade. The number of persons in the individual
studies has ranged from one to several hundred. Some
typical results are shown in Table IV.</p>

<p>7. <i>Quantities of Nutrients needed.</i>&mdash;For the proper nourishment
of the body, the important problem is how much protein,
fats and carbohydrates, or more simply, what amounts of protein
and potential energy are needed under varying circumstances,
to build and repair muscular and other tissues and to supply
energy for muscular work, heat and other forms of energy.
The answer to the problem is sought in the data obtained in
dietary studies with considerable numbers of people, and in
metabolism experiments with individuals in which the income
and expenditure of the body are measured. From the information
thus derived, different investigators have proposed so-called
dietary standards, such as are shown in the table below, but
unfortunately the experimental data are still insufficient for
entirely trustworthy figures of this sort; hence the term
&ldquo;standard&rdquo; as here used is misleading. The figures given are
not to be considered as exact and final as that would suggest;
they are merely tentative estimates of the average daily amounts
of nutrients and energy required. (It is to be especially noted
that these are available nutrients and fuel value rather than
total nutrients and energy.) Some of the values proposed by
other investigators are slightly larger than these, and others
are decidedly smaller, but these are the ones that have hitherto
been most commonly accepted in Europe and America.</p>

<p>8. <i>Hygienic Economy of Food.</i>&mdash;For people in good health, there
are two important rules to be observed in the regulation of the
diet. One is to choose the foods that &ldquo;agree&rdquo; with them, and
to avoid those which they cannot digest and assimilate without
harm; and the other is to use such sorts and quantities of foods
as will supply the kinds and amounts of nutrients needed by the
body and yet to avoid burdening it with superfluous material to
be disposed of at the cost of health and strength.</p>

<p>As for the first-mentioned rule, it is practically impossible to
give information that may be of more than general application.
There are people who, because of some individual peculiarity,
cannot use foods which for people in general are wholesome
and nutritious. Some persons cannot endure milk, others suffer
if they eat eggs, others have to eschew certain kinds of meat, or
are made uncomfortable by fruit; but such cases are exceptions.
Very little is known regarding the cause of these conditions. It
is possible that in the metabolic processes to which the ingredients
of the food are subjected in the body, or even during digestion
before the substances are actually taken into the body, compounds
may be formed that are in one way or another injurious.
Whatever the cause may be, it is literally true in this sense that
&ldquo;what is one man&rsquo;s meat is another man&rsquo;s poison,&rdquo; and each
must learn for himself what foods &ldquo;agree&rdquo; with him and what
ones do not. But for the great majority of people in health,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>220</span>
suitable combinations of the ordinary sorts of wholesome food
materials make a healthful diet. On the other hand, some foods
are of particular value at times, aside from their use for nourishment.
Fruits and green vegetables often benefit people greatly,
not as nutriment merely, for they may have very little actual
nutritive material, but because of fruit or vegetable acids or
other substances which they contain, and which sometimes
serve a most useful purpose.</p>

<p>The proper observance of the second rule mentioned requires
information regarding the demands of the body for food under
different circumstances. To supply this information is one
purpose of the effort to determine the so-called dietary standards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>221</span>
mentioned above. It should be observed, however, that these
are generally more applicable to the proper feeding of a group
or class of people as a whole than for particular individuals
in this class. The needs of individuals will vary largely from
the average in accordance with the activity and individuality.
Moreover, it is neither necessary nor desirable for the individual
to follow any standard exactly from day to day. It is requisite
only that the average supply shall be sufficient to meet the
demands of the body during a given period.</p>

<p>The cooking of food and other modes of preparing it for
consumption have much to do with its nutritive value. Many
materials which, owing to their mechanical condition or to
some other cause, are not particularly desirable food materials
in their natural state, are quite nutritious when cooked or otherwise
prepared for consumption. It is also a matter of common
experience that well-cooked food is wholesome and appetizing,
whereas the same material poorly prepared is unpalatable.
There are three chief purposes of cooking; the first is to change
the mechanical condition of the food. Heating changes the
structure of many food materials very materially, so that they
may be more easily chewed and brought into a condition in which
the digestive juices can act upon them more freely, and in this
way probably influencing the ease and thoroughness of digestion.
The second is to make the food more appetizing by improving
the appearance or flavour or both. Food which is attractive to
the eye and pleasing to the palate quickens the flow of saliva
and other digestive juices and thus aids digestion. The third
is to kill, by heat, disease germs, parasites or other dangerous
organisms that may be contained in food. This is often a very
important matter and applies to both animal and vegetable foods.
Scrupulous neatness should always be observed in storing,
handling and serving food. If ever cleanliness is desirable it
must be in the things we eat, and every care should be taken to
ensure it for the sake of health as well as of decency. Cleanliness
in this connexion means not only absence of visible dirt, but
freedom from undesirable bacteria and other minute organisms
and from worms and other parasites. If food, raw or cooked, is
kept in dirty places, peddled from dirty carts, prepared in dirty
rooms and in dirty dishes, or exposed to foul air, disease germs
and other offensive and dangerous substances may easily enter it.</p>

<p>9. <i>Pecuniary Economy of Food.</i>&mdash;Statistics of economy and of
cost of living in Great Britain, Germany and the United States
show that at least half, and commonly more, of the income of
wage-earners and other people in moderate circumstances is
expended for subsistence. The relatively large cost of food, and
the important influence of diet upon health and strength, make a
more widespread understanding of the subject of dietetics very
desirable. The maxim that &ldquo;the best is the cheapest&rdquo; does not
apply to food. The &ldquo;best&rdquo; food, in the sense of that which is
the finest in appearance and flavour and which is sold at the
highest price, is not generally the most economical.</p>

<p>The price of food is not regulated largely by its value for
nutriment. Its agreeableness to the palate or to the buyer&rsquo;s
fancy is a large factor in determining the current demand and
market price. There is no more nutriment in an ounce of protein
or fat from the tender-loin of beef than from the round or shoulder.
The protein of animal food has, however, some advantage over
that of vegetable foods in that it is more thoroughly, and perhaps
more easily, digested, for which reason it would be economical to
pay somewhat more for the same quantity of nutritive material
in the animal food. Furthermore, animal foods such as meats,
fish and the like, gratify the palate as most vegetable foods do
not. For persons in good health, foods in which the nutrients
are the most expensive are like costly articles of adornment.
People who can well afford them may be justified in buying
them, but they are not economical. The most economical food
is that which is at the same time most healthful and cheapest.</p>

<p>The variations in the cost of the actual nutriment in different
food materials may be illustrated by comparison of the amounts
of nutrients obtained for a given sum in the materials as bought
at ordinary market prices. This is done in Table VI., which
shows the amounts of available nutrients contained in the quantities
of different food materials that may be purchased for one
shilling at prices common in England.</p>

<p>When proper attention is given to the needs of the body for
food and the relation between cost and nutritive value of food
materials, it will be found that with care in the purchase and skill
in the preparation of food, considerable control may be had over

<p><span class="bold">DIETRICH, CHRISTIAN WILHELM ERNST<a name="ar77" id="ar77"></a></span> (1712-1774),
German painter, was born at Weimar, where he was brought up
early to the profession of art by his father Johann George, then
painter of miniatures to the court of the duke. Having been sent
to Dresden to perfect himself under the care of Alexander Thiele,
he had the good fortune to finish in two hours, at the age of
eighteen, a picture which attracted the attention of the king of
Saxony. Augustus II. was so pleased with Dietrich&rsquo;s readiness
of hand that he gave him means to study abroad, and visit in
succession the chief cities of Italy and the Netherlands. There
he learnt to copy and to imitate masters of the previous century
with a versatility truly surprising. Winckelmann, to whom he
had been recommended, did not hesitate to call him the Raphael
of landscape. Yet in this branch of his practice he merely
imitated Salvator Rosa and Everdingen. He was more successful
in aping the style of Rembrandt, and numerous examples of this
habit may be found in the galleries of St Petersburg, Vienna and
Dresden. At Dresden, indeed, there are pictures acknowledged
to be his, bearing the fictitious dates of 1636 and 1638, and the
name of Rembrandt. Among Dietrich&rsquo;s cleverest reproductions
we may account that of Ostade&rsquo;s manner in the &ldquo;Itinerant
Singers&rdquo; at the National Gallery. His skill in catching the
character of the later masters of Holland is shown in candlelight
scenes, such as the &ldquo;Squirrel and the Peep-Show&rdquo; at St
Petersburg, where we are easily reminded of Godfried Schalcken.
Dietrich tried every branch of art except portraits, painting
Italian and Dutch views alternately with Scripture scenes and
still life. In 1741 he was appointed court painter to Augustus III.
at Dresden, with an annual salary of 400 thalers (£60), conditional
on the production of four cabinet pictures a year. This condition,
no doubt, accounts for the presence of fifty-two of the master&rsquo;s
panels and canvases in one of the rooms at the Dresden museum.
Dietrich, though popular and probably the busiest artist of his
time, never produced anything of his own; and his imitations
are necessarily inferior to the originals which he affected to copy.
His best work is certainly that which he gave to engravings.
A collection of these at the British Museum, produced on the
general lines of earlier men, such as Ostade and Rembrandt,
reveal both spirit and skill. Dietrich, after his return from the
Peninsula, generally signed himself &ldquo;Dietericij,&rdquo; and with this
signature most of his extant pictures are inscribed. He died at
Dresden, after he had successively filled the important appointments
of director of the school of painting at the Meissen porcelain
factory and professor of the Dresden academy of arts.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DIETRICH OF BERN,<a name="ar78" id="ar78"></a></span> the name given in German popular
poetry to Theodoric the Great. The legendary history of Dietrich
differs so widely from the life of Theodoric that it has been
suggested that the two were originally unconnected. Medieval
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>222</span>
chroniclers, however, repeatedly asserted the identity of Dietrich
and Theodoric, although the more critical noted the anachronisms
involved in making Ermanaric (d. 376) and Attila (d. 453) contemporary
with Theodoric (b. 455). That the legend is based
on vague historical reminiscences is proved by the retention of
the names of Theodoric (Thiuda-reiks, Dietrich) and his father
Theudemir (Dietmar), by Dietrich&rsquo;s connexion with Bern
(Verona) and Raben (Ravenna). Something of the Gothic king&rsquo;s
character descended to Dietrich, familiarly called the Berner,
the favourite of German medieval saga heroes, although his
story did not leave the same mark on later German literature as
did that of the Nibelungs. The cycle of songs connected with his
name in South Germany is partially preserved in the Heldenbuch
(<i>q.v.</i>) in <i>Dietrich&rsquo;s Flucht</i>, the <i>Rabenschlacht</i> and <i>Alpharts Tod</i>;
but it was reserved for an Icelandic author, writing in Norway
in the 13th century, to compile, with many romantic additions, a
consecutive account of Dietrich. In this Norse prose redaction,
known as the <i>Vilkina Saga</i>, or more correctly the <i>Thidrekssaga</i>,
is incorporated much extraneous matter from the Nibelungen
and Wayland legends, in fact practically the whole of south
German heroic tradition.</p>

<p>There are traces of a form of the Dietrich legend in which he
was represented as starting out from Byzantium, in accordance
with historical tradition, for his conquest of Italy. But this
early disappeared, and was superseded by the existing legend,
in which, perhaps by an &ldquo;epic fusion&rdquo; with his father Theudemir,
he was associated with Attila, and then by an easy transition
with Ermanaric. Dietrich was driven from his kingdom of
Bern by his uncle Ermanaric. After years of exile at the court
of Attila he returned with a Hunnish army to Italy, and defeated
Ermanaric in the Rabenschlacht, or battle of Ravenna. Attila&rsquo;s
two sons, with Dietrich&rsquo;s brother, fell in the fight, and Dietrich
returned to Attila&rsquo;s court to answer for the death of the young
princes. This very improbable renunciation of the advantages of
his victory suggests that in the original version of the story the
Rabenschlacht was a defeat. In the poem of <i>Ermenrichs Tod</i>
he is represented as slaying Ermanaric, as in fact Theodoric slew
Odoacer. &ldquo;Otacher&rdquo; replaces Ermanaric as his adversary in the
<i>Hildebrandslied</i>, which relates how thirty years after the earlier
attempt he reconquered his Lombard kingdom. Dietrich&rsquo;s long
residence at Attila&rsquo;s court represents the youth and early manhood
of Theodoric spent at the imperial court and fighting in the
Balkan peninsula, and, in accordance with epic custom, the period
of exile was adorned with war-like exploits, with fights with
dragons and giants, most of which had no essential connexion
with the cycle. The romantic poems of <i>König Laurin</i>, <i>Sigenot</i>,
<i>Eckenlied</i> and <i>Virginal</i> are based largely on local traditions
originally independent of Dietrich. The court of Attila (Etzel)
was a ready bridge to the Nibelungen legend. In the final catastrophe
he was at length compelled, after steadily holding aloof
from the combat, to avenge the slaughter of his Amelungs by
the Burgundians, and delivered Hagen bound into the hands of
Kriemhild. The flame breath which anger induced from him
shows the influence of pure myth, but the tales of his demonic
origin and of his being carried off by the devil in the shape of a
black horse may safely be put down to the clerical hostility to
Theodoric&rsquo;s Arianism.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, Dietrich of Bern was the wise and just
monarch as opposed to Ermanaric, the typical tyrant of Germanic
legend. He was invariably represented as slow of provocation
and a friend of peace, but once roused to battle not even Siegfried
could withstand his onslaught. But probably Dietrich&rsquo;s fight
with Siegfried in Kriemhild&rsquo;s rose garden at Worms is a late
addition to the Rosengarten myth. The chief heroes of the
Dietrich cycle are his tutor and companion in arms, Hildebrand
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hildebrand, Lay of</a></span>), with his nephews the Wolfings
Alphart and Wolfhart; Wittich, who renounced his allegiance
to Dietrich and slew the sons of Attila; Heime and Biterolf.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The contents of the poems dealing with the Dietrich cycle are
summarized by Uhland in <i>Schriften zur Geschichte der Dichtung und
Sage</i> (Stuttgart, 1873). The <i>Thidrekssaga</i> (ed. C. Unger, Christiania,
1853) is translated into German by F. H. v. der Hagen in <i>Altdeutsche
und altnordische Heldensagen</i> (vols. i. and ii. 3rd ed., Breslau, 1872).
A summary of it forms the concluding chapter of T. Hodgkin&rsquo;s
<i>Theodoric the Goth</i> (1891). The variations in the Dietrich legend in
the Latin historians, in Old and Middle High German literature,
and in the northern saga, can be studied in W. Grimm&rsquo;s <i>Deutsche
Heldensage</i> (2nd ed., Berlin, 1867). There is a good account in English
in F. E. Sandbach&rsquo;s <i>Heroic Saga-cycle of Dietrich of Bern</i> (1906),
forming No. 15 of Alfred Nutt&rsquo;s <i>Popular Studies in Mythology</i>, and
another in M. Bentinck Smith&rsquo;s translation of Dr O. L. Jiriczek&rsquo;s
<i>Deutsche Heldensage</i> (<i>Northern Legends</i>, London, 1902). For modern
German authorities and commentators see B. Symons, &ldquo;Deutsche
Heldensage&rdquo; in H. Paul&rsquo;s <i>Grd. d. german. Phil.</i> (Strassburg, new ed.,

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DIEZ, FRIEDRICH CHRISTIAN<a name="ar79" id="ar79"></a></span> (1794-1876), German
philologist, was born at Giessen, in Hesse-Darmstadt, on the 15th
of March 1794. He was educated first at the gymnasium and
then at the university of his native town. There he studied
classics under Friedrich Gottlieb Welcker (1784-1868) who had
just returned from a two years&rsquo; residence in Italy to fill the chair
of archaeology and Greek literature. It was Welcker who
kindled in him a love of Italian poetry, and thus gave the first
bent to his genius. In 1813 he joined the Hesse corps as a
volunteer and served in the French campaign. Next year he
returned to his books, and this short taste of military service was
the only break in a long and uneventful life of literary labours.
By his parents&rsquo; desire he applied himself for a short time to law,
but a visit to Goethe in 1818 gave a new direction to his studies,
and determined his future career. Goethe had been reading
Raynouard&rsquo;s <i>Selections from the Romance Poets</i>, and advised the
young scholar to explore the rich mine of Provençal literature
which the French savant had opened up. This advice was
eagerly followed, and henceforth Diez devoted himself to Romance
literature. He thus became the founder of Romance philology.
After supporting himself for some years by private teaching, he
removed in 1822 to Bonn, where he held the position of privatdocent.
In 1823 he published his first work, <i>An Introduction
to Romance Poetry</i>; in the following year appeared <i>The Poetry
of the Troubadours</i>, and in 1829 <i>The Lives and Works of the
Troubadours</i>. In 1830 he was called to the chair of modern
literature. The rest of his life was mainly occupied with the
composition of the two great works on which his fame rests, the
<i>Grammar of the Romance Languages</i> (1836-1844), and the <i>Lexicon
of the Romance Languages&mdash;Italian, Spanish and French</i> (1853);
in these two works Diez did for the Romance group of languages
what Jacob Grimm did for the Teutonic family. He died at
Bonn on the 29th of May 1876.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The earliest French philologists, such as Perion and Henri Estienne,
had sought to discover the origin of French in Greek and even in
Hebrew. For more than a century Ménage&rsquo;s <i>Etymological Dictionary</i>
held the field without a rival. Considering the time at which it was
written (1650), it was a meritorious work, but philology was then in
the empirical stage, and many of Ménage&rsquo;s derivations (such as
that of &ldquo;rat&rdquo; from the Latin &ldquo;mus,&rdquo; or of &ldquo;haricot&rdquo; from &ldquo;faba&rdquo;)
have since become bywords among philologists. A great advance
was made by Raynouard, who by his critical editions of the works
of the Troubadours, published in the first years of the 19th century,
laid the foundations on which Diez afterwards built. The difference
between Diez&rsquo;s method and that of his predecessors is well stated by
him in the preface to his dictionary. In sum it is the difference
between science and guess-work. The scientific method is to follow
implicitly the discovered principles and rules of phonology, and not
to swerve a foot&rsquo;s breadth from them unless plain, actual exceptions
shall justify it; to follow the genius of the language, and by cross-questioning
to elicit its secrets; to gauge each letter and estimate
the value which attaches to it in each position; and lastly to possess
the true philosophic spirit which is prepared to welcome any new
fact, though it may modify or upset the most cherished theory.
Such is the historical method which Diez pursues in his grammar
and dictionary. To collect and arrange facts is, as he tells us, the
sole secret of his success, and he adds in other words the famous
apophthegm of Newton, &ldquo;hypotheses non fingo.&rdquo; The introduction
to the grammar consists of two parts:&mdash;the first discusses the Latin,
Greek and Teutonic elements common to the Romance languages;
the second treats of the six dialects separately, their origin and the
elements peculiar to each. The grammar itself is divided into four
books, on phonology, on flexion, on the formation of words by
composition and derivation, and on syntax.</p>

<p>His dictionary is divided into two parts. The first contains words
common to two at least of the three principal groups of Romance:&mdash;Italian,
Spanish and Portuguese, and Provençal and French. The
Italian, as nearest the original, is placed at the head of each article.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>223</span>
The second part treats of words peculiar to one group. There is no
separate glossary of Wallachian.</p>

<p>Of the introduction to the grammar there is an English translation
by C. B. Cayley. The dictionary has been published in a remodelled
form for English readers by T. C. Donkin.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DIEZ,<a name="ar80" id="ar80"></a></span> a town of Germany, in the Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau,
romantically situated in the deep valley of the Lahn,
here crossed by an old bridge, 30 m. E. from Coblenz on the
railway to Wetzlar. Pop. 4500. It is overlooked by a former
castle of the counts of Nassau-Dillenburg, now a prison. Close
by, on an eminence above the river, lies the castle of Oranienstein,
formerly a Benedictine nunnery and now a cadet school,
with beautiful gardens. There are a Roman Catholic and two
Evangelical churches. The new part of the town is well built
and contains numerous pretty villa residences. In addition to
extensive iron-works there are sawmills and tanneries. In the
vicinity are Fachingen, celebrated for its mineral waters, and
the majestic castle of Schaumburg belonging to the prince of
Waldeck-Pyrmont.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DIFFERENCES, CALCULUS OF<a name="ar81" id="ar81"></a></span> (<i>Theory of Finite Differences</i>),
that branch of mathematics which deals with the successive
differences of the terms of a series.</p>

<p>1. The most important of the cases to which mathematical
methods can be applied are those in which the terms of the series
are the values, taken at stated intervals (regular or irregular), of
a continuously varying quantity. In these cases the formulae
of finite differences enable certain quantities, whose exact value
depends on the law of variation (<i>i.e.</i> the law which governs the
relative magnitude of these terms) to be calculated, often with
great accuracy, from the given terms of the series, without
explicit reference to the law of variation itself. The methods
used may be extended to cases where the series is a double series
(series of double entry), <i>i.e.</i> where the value of each term depends
on the values of a pair of other quantities.</p>

<p>2. The <i>first differences</i> of a series are obtained by subtracting
from each term the term immediately preceding it. If these are
treated as terms of a new series, the first differences of this series
are the <i>second differences</i> of the original series; and so on.
The successive differences are also called <i>differences of the first,
second, ... order</i>. The differences of successive orders are most
conveniently arranged in successive columns of a table thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>3. The formal relations between the terms of the series and the
differences may be seen by comparing the arrangements (A) and (B)
in fig. 1. In (A) the various terms and differences are the same as in
§ 2, but placed differently. In
(B) we take a new series of
terms &alpha;, &beta;, &gamma;, &delta;, commencing
with the same term &alpha;, and take
the successive sums of pairs of
terms, instead of the successive
differences, but place them to
the left instead of to the right.
It will be seen, in the first
place, that the successive terms
in (A), reading downwards to the right, and the successive
terms in (B), reading downwards to the left, consist each of
a series of terms whose coefficients follow the binomial law; <i>i.e.</i>
the coefficients in b &minus; a, c &minus; 2b + a, d &minus; 3c + 3b &minus; a, ... and in
&alpha; + &beta;, &alpha; + 2&beta; + &gamma;, &alpha; + 3&beta; + 3&gamma; + &delta;, ... are respectively the same as
in y &minus; x, (y &minus; x)², (y &minus; x)³, ... and in x + y, (x + y)², (x + y)³,....
In the second place, it will be seen that the relations between the
various terms in (A) are identical with the relations between the
similarly placed terms in (B); <i>e.g.</i> &beta; + &gamma; is the difference of &alpha; + 2&beta; + &gamma;
and &alpha; + &beta;, just as c &minus; b is the difference of c and b: and d &minus; c is the sum
of c &minus; b and d &minus; 2c + b, just as &beta; + 2&gamma; + &delta; is the sum of &beta; + &gamma; and &gamma; + &delta;.
Hence if we take &beta;, &gamma;, &delta;, ... of (B) as being the same as b &minus; a,
c &minus; 2b + a, d &minus; 3c + 3b &minus; a, ... of (A), all corresponding terms in the
two diagrams will be the same.</p>

<p>Thus we obtain the two principal formulae connecting terms and
differences. If we provisionally describe b &minus; a, c &minus; 2b + a, ... as the
first, second, ... differences of the particular term a (§ 7), then
(i.) the nth difference of a is</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr><td rowspan="2">l &minus; nk + ... + (-1)<span class="sp">n-2</span></td>
    <td>n·n &minus; 1</td>
    <td rowspan="2">c + (-1)<span class="sp">n-1</span> nb + (-1)<span class="sp">n</span> a,</td></tr>
<tr><td class="denom">1·2</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="noind">where l, k ... are the (n + 1)th, nth, ... terms of the series a, b, c,
...; the coefficients being those of the terms in the expansion of
(y &minus; x)<span class="sp">n</span>: and (ii.) the (n + 1)th term of the series, <i>i.e.</i> the nth term
after a, is</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr><td rowspan="2">a + n&beta; +</td> <td>n·n &minus; 1</td> <td rowspan="2">&gamma; + ...</td></tr>
<tr><td class="denom">1·2</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">where &beta;, &gamma;, ... are the first, second, ... differences of a; the
coefficients being those of the terms in the expansion of (x + y)<span class="sp">n</span>.</p>

<p>4. Now suppose we treat the terms a, b, c, ... as being themselves
the first differences of another series. Then, if the first term
of this series is N, the subsequent terms are N + a, N + a + b, N + a +
b + c, ...; <i>i.e.</i> the difference between the (n + 1)th term and the
first term is the sum of the first n terms of the original series. The
term N, in the diagram (A), will come above and to the left of a; and
we see, by (ii.) of § 3, that the sum of the first n terms of the original
series is</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr><td rowspan="2" class="f200 np">(</td>
 <td rowspan="2">N + na +</td> <td>n·n &minus; 1</td>
 <td rowspan="2">&beta; + ...</td> <td rowspan="2" class="f200 np">)</td>
 <td rowspan="2">&minus; N = na +</td> <td>n·n &minus; 1</td> <td rowspan="2">&beta; +</td>
 <td>n·n &minus; 1·n &minus; 2</td> <td rowspan="2">&gamma; + ...</td></tr>
<tr><td class="denom">1·2</td> <td class="denom">1·2</td> <td class="denom">1 · 2 · 3</td></tr>
</table>

<p>5. As an example, take the arithmetical series</p>

<p class="center">a, a + p, a + 2p, ...</p>

<p class="noind">The first differences are p, p, p, ... and the differences of any higher
order are zero. Hence, by (ii.) of § 3, the (n + 1)th term is a + np, and,
by § 4, the sum of the first n terms is na + ½n(n &minus; 1)p = ½n{2a + (n &minus; 1)p}.</p>

<p>6 As another example, take the series 1, 8, 27, ... the terms of
which are the cubes of 1, 2, 3, ... The first, second and third
differences of the first term are 7, 12 and 6, and it may be shown
(§ 14 (i.)) that all differences of a higher order are zero. Hence the
sum of the first n terms is</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr><td rowspan="2">n + 7</td> <td>n·n &minus; 1</td>

<p>7. In § 3 we have described b &minus; a, c &minus; 2b + a, ... as the first,
second, ... differences of a. This ascription of the differences
to particular terms of the series is quite arbitrary. If we read the
differences in the table of § 2 upwards to the right instead of downwards
to the right, we might describe e &minus; d, e &minus; 2d + c, ... as the
first, second, ... differences of e. On the other hand, the term of
greatest weight in c &minus; 2b + a, <i>i.e.</i> the term which has the numerically
greatest coefficient, is b, and therefore c &minus; 2b + a might properly be
regarded as the second difference of b, and similarly e &minus; 4d + 6c &minus; 4b + a
might be regarded as the fourth difference of c. These three
methods of regarding the differences lead to three different systems
of notation, which are described in §§ 9, 10 and 11.</p>

<p class="center pt2"><i>Notation of Differences and Sums.</i></p>

<p>8. It is convenient to denote the terms a, b, c, ... of the series
by u<span class="su">0</span>, u<span class="su">1</span>, u<span class="su">2</span>, u<span class="su">3</span>, ... If we merely have the terms of the series, u<span class="su">n</span>
may be regarded as meaning the (n + 1)th term. Usually, however,
the terms are the values of a quantity u, which is a function of
another quantity x, and the values of x, to which a, b, c, ... correspond,
proceed by a constant difference h. If x<span class="su">0</span> and u<span class="su">0</span> are a pair
of corresponding values of x and u, and if any other value x<span class="su">0</span> + mh of x
and the corresponding value of u are denoted by x<span class="su">m</span> and u<span class="su">m</span>, then
the terms of the series will be ... u<span class="su">n-2</span>, u<span class="su">n-1</span>, u<span class="su">n</span>, u<span class="su">n+1</span>, u<span class="su">n+2</span> ..., corresponding
to values of x denoted by  ... x<span class="su">n-2</span>, x<span class="su">n-1</span>, x<span class="su">n</span>, x<span class="su">n+1</span>, x<span class="su">n+2</span>....</p>

<p>9. In the <i>advancing-difference notation</i> u<span class="su">n+1</span> &minus; u<span class="su">n</span> is denoted by
&Delta;u<span class="su">n</span>. The differences &Delta;u<span class="su">0</span>, &Delta;u<span class="su">1</span>, &Delta;u<span class="su">2</span> ... may then be regarded as
values of a function &Delta;u corresponding to values of x proceeding by
constant difference h; and therefore &Delta;u<span class="su">n+1</span> &minus; &Delta;u<span class="su">n</span> denoted by &Delta;&Delta;u<span class="su">n</span>,
or, more briefly, &Delta;²u<span class="su">n</span>; and so on. Hence the table of differences in
§ 2, with the corresponding values of x and of u placed opposite each
other in the ordinary manner of mathematical tables, becomes</p>

<p>The terms of the series of which ... u<span class="su">n-1</span>, u<span class="su">n</span>, u<span class="su">n+1</span>, ... are
the first differences are denoted by &Sigma;u, with proper suffixes, so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>224</span>
that this series is ... &Sigma;u<span class="su">n-1</span>, &Sigma;u<span class="su">n</span>, &Sigma;u<span class="su">n+1</span>.... The suffixes are
chosen so that we may have &Delta;&Sigma;u<span class="su">n</span> = u<span class="su">n</span>, whatever n may be; and
therefore (§ 4) &Sigma;u<span class="su">n</span> may be regarded as being the sum of the terms
of the series up to and including u<span class="su">n-1</span>. Thus if we write &Sigma;u<span class="su">n-1</span> =
C + u<span class="su">n-2</span>, where C is any constant, we shall have</p>

<table class="ws" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcl">&Sigma;u<span class="su">n</span> = &Sigma;u<span class="su">n-1</span> + &Delta;&Sigma;u<span class="su">n-1</span> = C + u<span class="su">n-2</span> + u<span class="su">n-1</span>,</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">&Sigma;u<span class="su">n+1</span> = C + u<span class="su">n-2</span> + u<span class="su">n-1</span> + u<span class="su">n</span>,</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="noind">and so on. This is true whatever C may be, so that the knowledge
of ... u<span class="su">n-1</span>, u<span class="su">n</span>, ... gives us no knowledge of the exact value
of &Sigma;u<span class="su">n</span>; in other words, C is an arbitrary constant, the value of
which must be supposed to be the same throughout any operations in
which we are concerned with values of &Sigma;u corresponding to different
suffixes.</p>

<p>There is another symbol E, used in conjunction with u to denote
the next term in the series. Thus Eu<span class="su">n</span> means u<span class="su">n+1</span>, so that
Eu<span class="su">n</span> = u<span class="su">n</span> + &Delta;u<span class="su">n</span>.</p>

<p>10. Corresponding to the advancing-difference notation there is
a <i>receding-difference</i> notation, in which u<span class="su">n+1</span> &minus; u<span class="su">n</span> is regarded as
a difference of u<span class="su">n+1</span>, and may be denoted by &Delta;&prime;u<span class="su">n+1</span>, and similarly
u<span class="su">n+1</span> &minus; 2u<span class="su">n</span> + u<span class="su">n-1</span> may be denoted by &Delta;&prime;²u<span class="su">n+1</span>. This notation is only
required for certain special purposes, and the usage is not settled
(§ 19 (ii.)).</p>

<p>11. The <i>central-difference</i> notation depends on treating
u<span class="su">n+1</span> &minus; 2u<span class="su">n</span> &minus; u<span class="su">n-1</span> as the second <span class="correction" title="amended from dfference">difference</span> of u<span class="su">n</span>, and therefore as
corresponding to the value x<span class="su">n</span>; but there is no settled system of
notation. The following seems to be the most convenient. Since u<span class="su">n</span> is
a function of x<span class="su">n</span>, and the second difference u<span class="su">n+2</span> &minus; 2u<span class="su">n+1</span> + u<span class="su">n</span> is a function
of x<span class="su">n+1</span>, the first difference u<span class="su">n+1</span> &minus; u<span class="su">n</span> must be regarded as a function
of x<span class="su">n+1/2</span>, <i>i.e.</i> of ½(x<span class="su">n</span> + x<span class="su">n+1</span>). We therefore write u<span class="su">n+1</span> &minus; u<span class="su">n</span> = &delta;u<span class="su">n+1/2</span>,
and each difference in the table in § 9 will have the same suffix
as the value of x in the same horizontal line; or, if the difference
is of an odd order, its suffix will be the means of those of the two
nearest values of x. This is shown in the table below.</p>

<p>In this notation, instead of using the symbol E, we use a symbol &mu;
to denote the mean of two consecutive values of u, or of two consecutive
differences of the same order, the suffixes being assigned on the
same principle as in the case of the differences. Thus</p>

<p class="center">&mu;u<span class="su">n+1/2</span> = ½(u<span class="su">n</span> + u<span class="su">n+1</span>, &mu;&delta;u<span class="su">n</span> = ½(&delta;u<span class="su">n-1/2</span> + &delta;u<span class="su">n+1/2</span>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>If we take the means of the differences of odd order immediately
above and below the horizontal line through any value of x, these
means, with the differences of even order in that line, constitute the
<i>central differences</i> of the corresponding value of u. Thus the table
of central differences is as follows, the values obtained as means
being placed in brackets to distinguish them from the actual
differences:&mdash;</p>

<p>Similarly, by taking the means of consecutive values of u and also
of consecutive differences of even order, we should get a series of
terms and differences central to the intervals x<span class="su">n-2</span> to x<span class="su">n-1</span>, x<span class="su">n-1</span> to
x<span class="su">n</span>, ....</p>

<p>The terms of the series of which the values of u are the first differences
are denoted by &sigma;u, with suffixes on the same principle; the
suffixes being chosen so that &delta;&sigma;u<span class="su">n</span> shall be equal to u<span class="su">n</span>. Thus, if</p>

<p class="noind">C being an arbitrary constant which must remain the same throughout
any series of operations.</p>

<p class="center pt2"><i>Operators and Symbolic Methods.</i></p>

<p>12. There are two further stages in the use of the symbols &Delta;, &Sigma;,
&delta;, &sigma;, &amp;c., which are not essential for elementary treatment but
lead to powerful methods of deduction.</p>

<p>(i.) Instead of treating &Delta;u as a function of x, so that &Delta;u<span class="su">n</span> means
(&Delta;u)<span class="su">n</span>, we may regard &Delta; as denoting an <i>operation</i> performed on u,
and take &Delta;u<span class="su">n</span> as meaning &Delta;.u<span class="su">n</span>. This applies to the other symbols
E, &delta;, &amp;c., whether taken simply or in combination. Thus &Delta;Eu<span class="su">n</span>
means that we first replace u<span class="su">n</span> by u<span class="su">n+1</span>, and then replace this by
u<span class="su">n+2</span> &minus; u<span class="su">n+1</span>.</p>

<p>(ii.) The operations &Delta;, E, &delta;, and &mu;, whether performed separately
or in combination, or in combination also with numerical multipliers
and with the operation of differentiation denoted by D (&equiv; d/dx),
follow the ordinary rules of algebra: <i>e.g.</i> &Delta;(u<span class="su">n</span> + v<span class="su">n</span>) = &Delta;u<span class="su">n</span> + &Delta;v<span class="su">n</span>,
&Delta;Du<span class="su">n</span> = D&Delta;u<span class="su">n</span>, &amp;c. Hence the symbols can be separated from the
functions on which the operations are performed, and treated as
if they were algebraical quantities. For instance, we have</p>

<p class="center">E·u<span class="su">n</span> = u<span class="su">n+1</span> = u<span class="su">n</span> + &Delta;u<span class="su">n</span> = 1·u<span class="su">n</span> + &Delta;·u<span class="su">n</span>,</p>

<p class="noind">so that we may write E = 1 + &Delta;, or &Delta; = E &minus; 1. The first of these is
nothing more than a statement, in concise form, that if we take two
quantities, subtract the first from the second, and add the result to
the first, we get the second. This seems almost a truism. But, if
we deduce E<span class="sp">n</span> = (1 + &Delta;)<span class="sp">n</span>, &Delta;<span class="sp">n</span> = (E-1)<span class="sp">n</span>, and expand by the binomial
theorem and then operate on u<span class="su">0</span>, we get the general formulae</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr><td rowspan="2">u<span class="su">n</span> = u<span class="su">0</span> + n&Delta;u<span class="su">0</span> +</td> <td>n·n &minus; 1</td>

<tr><td class="denom">1·2</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">which are identical with the formulae in (ii.) and (i.) of § 3.</p>

<p>(iii.) What has been said under (ii.) applies, with certain reservations,
to the operations &Sigma; and &sigma;, and to the operation which represents
integration. The latter is sometimes denoted by D<span class="sp">-1</span>; and, since
&Delta;&Sigma;u<span class="su">n</span> = u<span class="su">n</span>, and &delta;&sigma;u<span class="su">n</span> = u<span class="su">n</span>, we might similarly replace &Sigma; and &sigma; by
&Delta;<span class="sp">-1</span> and &delta;<span class="sp">-1</span>. These symbols can be combined with &Delta;, E, &amp;c.
according to the ordinary laws of algebra, provided that proper
account is taken of the arbitrary constants introduced by the
operations D<span class="sp">-1</span>, &Delta;<span class="sp">-1</span>, &delta;<span class="sp">-1</span>.</p>

<p class="center pt2"><i>Applications to Algebraical Series.</i></p>

<p>13. <i>Summation of Series.</i>&mdash;If u<span class="su">r</span>, denotes the (r + 1)th term of a
series, and if v<span class="su">r</span> is a function of r such that &Delta;v<span class="su">r</span> = u<span class="su">r</span> for all integral
values of r, then the sum of the terms u<span class="su">m</span>, u<span class="su">m+1</span>, ... u<span class="su">n</span> is
v<span class="su">n+1</span> &minus; v<span class="su">m</span>. Thus the sum of a number of terms of a series may often

<p>14. <i>Rational Integral Functions.</i>&mdash;(i.) If u<span class="su">r</span> is a rational integral
function of r of degree p, then &Delta;u<span class="su">r</span>, is a rational integral function of r

<p>(ii.) A particular case is that of a <i>factorial</i>, <i>i.e.</i> a product of the
form (r + a + 1) (r + a + 2) ... (r + b), each factor exceeding the preceding
factor by 1. We have</p>

<p class="center">&Delta; · (r + a + 1) (r + a + 2) ... (r + b) = (b &minus; a)·(r + a + 2) ... (r + b),</p>

<p class="noind">whence, changing a into a-1,</p>

<p class="center">&Sigma;(r + a + 1) (r + a + 2) ... (r + b) = <i>const.</i> + (r + a)(r + a + 1) ... (r + b)/(b &minus; a + 1).</p>

<p class="noind">A similar method can be applied to the series whose (r + 1)th
term is of the form 1/(r + a + 1) (r + a + 2) ... (r + b).</p>

<p>(iii.) Any rational integral function can be converted into the sum
of a number of factorials; and thus the sum of a series of which such
a function is the general term can be found. For example, it may
be shown in this way that the sum of the pth powers of the first n
natural numbers is a rational integral function of n of degree p + 1,
the coefficient of n<span class="sp">p+1</span> being 1/(p + 1).</p>

<p>15. <i>Difference-equations.</i>&mdash;The summation of the series ...
+ u<span class="su">n+2</span> + u<span class="su">n-1</span> + u<span class="su">n</span> is a solution of the <i>difference-equation</i> &Delta;v<span class="su">n</span> = u<span class="su">n+1</span>,
which may also be written (E &minus; 1)v<span class="su">n</span> = u<span class="su">n+1</span>. This is a simple form
of difference-equation. There are several forms which have been
investigated; a simple form, more general than the above, is the
<i>linear equation</i> with <i>constant coefficients</i>&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">v<span class="su">n+m</span> + a<span class="su">1</span>v<span class="su">n+m-1</span> + a<span class="su">2</span>v<span class="su">n+m-2</span> + ... + a<span class="su">m</span>v<span class="su">n</span> = N,</p>

<p class="noind">where a<span class="su">1</span>, a<span class="su">2</span>, ... a<span class="su">m</span> are constants, and N is a given function of n.
This may be written</p>

<p class="center">(E<span class="sp">m</span> + a<span class="su">1</span>E<span class="sp">m-1</span> + ... + a<span class="su">m</span>)v<span class="su">n</span> = N</p>

<p class="noind">or</p>

<p class="center">(E &minus; p<span class="su">1</span>)(E &minus; p<span class="su">2</span>) ... (E &minus; p<span class="su">m</span>)v<span class="su">n</span> = N.</p>

<p class="noind">The solution, if p<span class="su">1</span>, p<span class="su">2</span>, ... p<span class="su">m</span> are all different, is v<span class="su">n</span> = C<span class="su">1</span>p<span class="su">1</span><span class="sp">n</span> +
C<span class="su">2</span>p<span class="su">2</span><span class="sp">n</span> + ... + C<span class="su">m</span>p<span class="su">m</span><span class="sp">n</span> + V<span class="su">n</span>, where C<span class="su">1</span>, C<span class="su">2</span> ... are constants, and
v<span class="su">n</span> = V<span class="su">n</span> is any one solution of the equation. The method of finding
a value for V<span class="su">n</span> depends on the form of N. Certain modifications are
required when two or more of the p&rsquo;s are equal.</p>

<p>It should be observed, in all cases of this kind, that, in describing
C<span class="su">1</span>, C<span class="su">2</span> as &ldquo;constants,&rdquo; it is meant that the value of any one, as C<span class="su">1</span>, is
the same for all values of n occurring in the series. A &ldquo;constant&rdquo;
may, however, be a periodic function of n.</p>

<p class="center pt2"><i>Applications to Continuous Functions.</i></p>

<p>16. The cases of greatest practical importance are those in which
u is a continuous function of x. The terms u<span class="su">1</span>, u<span class="su">2</span> ... of the series
then represent the successive values of u corresponding to x = x<span class="su">1</span>, x<span class="su">2</span>....
The important applications of the theory in these cases are to
(i.) relations between differences and differential coefficients, (ii.)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>225</span>
interpolation, or the determination of intermediate values of u, and
(iii.) relations between sums and integrals.</p>

<p>17. Starting from any pair of values x<span class="su">0</span> and u<span class="su">0</span>, we may suppose
the interval h from x<span class="su">0</span> to x<span class="su">1</span> to be divided into q equal portions. If
we suppose the corresponding values of u to be obtained, and their
differences taken, the successive advancing differences of u<span class="su">0</span> being
denoted by &part;u<span class="su">0</span>, &part;²u<span class="su">0</span> ..., we have (§ 3 (ii.))</p>

<p>18. <i>Differences and Differential Coefficients.</i>&mdash;The various formulae

quantities. Thus the relation E = e<span class="sp">hD</span> (§ 17) gives</p>

<p>The formulae connecting central differences with differential
coefficients are based on the relations

<p>When u is a rational integral function of x, each of the above series
is a terminating series. In other cases the series will be an infinite
one, and may be divergent; but it may be used for purposes of
approximation up to a certain point, and there will be a &ldquo;remainder,&rdquo;
the limits of whose magnitude will be determinate.</p>

<p>19. <i>Sums and Integrals.</i>&mdash;The relation between a sum and an
integral is usually expressed by the <i>Euler-Maclaurin formula</i>. The
principle of this formula is that, if u<span class="su">m</span> and u<span class="su">m+1</span>, are ordinates of a
curve, distant h from one another, then for a first approximation to
the area of the curve between u<span class="su">m</span> and u<span class="su">m+1</span> we have ½h(u<span class="su">m</span> + u<span class="su">m+1</span>),
and the difference between this and the true value of the area can
be expressed as the difference of two expressions, one of which is a
function of x<span class="su">m</span>, and the other is the same function of x<span class="su">m+1</span>.
Denoting these by &phi;(x<span class="su">m</span>) and &phi;(x<span class="su">m+1</span>), we have</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION,<a name="ar82" id="ar82"></a></span> in mathematics, a relation between
one or more functions and their differential coefficients.
The subject is treated here in two parts: (1) an elementary
introduction dealing with the more commonly recognized types
of differential equations which can be solved by rule; and (2) the
general theory.</p>

<p class="center pt2"><i>Part I.&mdash;Elementary Introduction.</i></p>

<p>Of equations involving only one independent variable, x (known
as <i>ordinary</i> differential equations), and one dependent variable, y,
and containing only the first differential coefficient dy/dx (and therefore
said to be of the first <i>order</i>), the simplest form is that reducible
to the type</p>

<p class="center">dy/dx = &fnof;(x)/F(y),</p>

<p class="noind">leading to the result &fnof;F(y)dy &minus; &fnof;&fnof;(x)dx = A, where A is an arbitrary
constant; this result is said to solve the differential equation, the
problem of evaluating the integrals belonging to the integral calculus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>226</span></p>

<p>Another simple form is</p>

<p class="center">dy/dx + yP = Q,</p>

<p class="noind">where P, Q are functions of x only; this is known as the linear equation,
since it contains y and dy/dx only to the first degree. If &fnof;Pdx = u, we clearly have</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr><td>d</td> <td rowspan="2">(ye<span class="sp">u</span>) = e<span class="sp">u</span></td> <td rowspan="2" class="f200 np">(</td>
<td>dy</td> <td rowspan="2">+ Py</td> <td rowspan="2" class="f200 np">)</td>
<td rowspan="2">= e<span class="sp">u</span>Q,</td></tr>
<tr><td class="denom">dx</td> <td class="denom">dx</td> </tr></table>

<p class="noind">so that y = e<span class="sp">-u</span>(&fnof;e<span class="sp">u</span>Qdx + A) solves the equation, and is the only
possible solution, A being an arbitrary constant. The rule for the
solution of the linear equation is thus to multiply the equation by
e<span class="sp">u</span>, where u = &fnof;Pdx.</p>

<p>A third simple and important form is that denoted by</p>

<p class="center">y = px + &fnof;(p),</p>

<p class="noind">where p is an abbreviation for dy/dx; this is known as Clairaut&rsquo;s
form. By differentiation in regard to x it gives</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr><td rowspan="2">p = p + x</td> <td>dp</td>
 <td rowspan="2">+ &fnof;&prime;(p)</td> <td>dp</td> <td rowspan="2">,</td></tr>
<tr><td class="denom">dx</td> <td class="denom">dx</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">where</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr><td rowspan="2">&fnof;&prime;(p) =</td> <td>d</td>
 <td rowspan="2">&fnof;(p);</td></tr>
<tr><td class="denom">dp</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">thus, either (i.) dp/dx = 0, that is, p is constant on the curve satisfying
the differential equation, which curve is thus any one of the
straight lines y = cx = &fnof;(c), where c is an arbitrary constant, or else,
(ii.) x + &fnof;&prime;(p) = 0; if this latter hypothesis be taken, and p be eliminated
between x + &fnof;&prime;(p) = 0 and y = px + &fnof;(p), a relation connecting x and y,
not containing an arbitrary constant, will be found, which obviously
represents the envelope of the straight lines y = cx + &fnof;(c).</p>

<p>In general if a differential equation &phi;(x, y, dy/dx) = 0 be satisfied
by any one of the curves F(x, y, c) = 0, where c is an arbitrary constant,
it is clear that the envelope of these curves, when existent, must
also satisfy the differential equation; for this equation prescribes
a relation connecting only the co-ordinates x, y and the differential
coefficient dy/dx, and these three quantities are the same at any
point of the envelope for the envelope and for the particular curve
of the family which there touches the envelope. The relation expressing
the equation of the envelope is called a <i>singular</i> solution of
the differential equation, meaning an <i>isolated</i> solution, as not being
one of a family of curves depending upon an arbitrary parameter.</p>

<p>An extended form of Clairaut&rsquo;s equation expressed by</p>

<p class="center">y = xF(p) + &fnof;(p)</p>

<p class="noind">may be similarly solved by first differentiating in regard to p, when
it reduces to a linear equation of which x is the dependent and p the
independent variable; from the integral of this linear equation, and the
original differential equation, the quantity p is then to be eliminated.</p>

<p>Other types of solvable differential equations of the first order
are (1)</p>

<p class="center">M dy/dx = N,</p>

<p class="noind">where M, N are homogeneous polynomials in x and y, of the same
order; by putting v = y/x and eliminating y, the equation becomes
of the first type considered above, in v and x. An equation (aB &#8823; bA)</p>

<p class="center">(ax + by + c)dy/dx = Ax + By + C</p>

<p class="noind">may be reduced to this rule by first putting x + h, y + k for x and y,
and determining h, k so that ah + bk + c = 0, Ah + Bk + C = 0.</p>

<p>(2) An equation in which y does not explicitly occur,</p>

<p class="center">&fnof;(x, dy/dx) = 0,</p>

<p class="noind">may, theoretically, be reduced to the type dy/dx = F(x); similarly
an equation F(y, dy/dx) = 0.</p>

<p>(3) An equation</p>

<p class="center">&fnof;(dy/dx, x, y) = 0,</p>

<p class="noind">which is an integral polynomial in dy/dx, may, theoretically, be
solved for dy/dx, as an algebraic equation; to any root dy/dx = F<span class="su">1</span>(x, y)
corresponds, suppose, a solution &phi;<span class="su">1</span>(x, y, c) = 0, where c is an arbitrary
constant; the product equation &phi;<span class="su">1</span>(x, y, c)&phi;<span class="su">2</span>(x, y, c) ... = 0,
consisting of as many factors as there were values of dy/dx, is
effectively as general as if we wrote &phi;<span class="su">1</span>(x, y, c<span class="su">1</span>)&phi;<span class="su">2</span>(x, y, c<span class="su">2</span>) ... = 0;
for, to evaluate the first form, we must necessarily consider the
factors separately, and nothing is then gained by the multiple
notation for the various arbitrary constants. The equation
&phi;<span class="su">1</span>(x, y, c)&phi;<span class="su">2</span>(x, y, c) ... = 0 is thus the solution of the given differential
equation.</p>

<p>In all these cases there is, except for cases of singular solutions, one
and only one arbitrary constant in the most general solution of the
differential equation; that this must necessarily be so we may take
as obvious, the differential equation being supposed to arise by
elimination of this constant from the equation expressing its solution
and the equation obtainable from this by differentiation in regard
to x.</p>

<p>A further type of differential equation of the first order, of the form</p>

<p class="center">dy/dx = A + By + Cy²</p>

<p class="noind">in which A, B, C are functions of x, will be briefly considered below
under differential equations of the second order.</p>

<p>When we pass to ordinary differential equations of the second order,
that is, those expressing a relation between x, y, dy/dx and d²y/dx²,
the number of types for which the solution can be found by a known
procedure is very considerably reduced. Consider the general linear
equation</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr><td>d²y</td> <td rowspan="2">+ P</td> <td>dy</td> <td rowspan="2">+ Qy = R,</td></tr>
<tr><td class="denom">dx²</td> <td class="denom">dx</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">where P, Q, R are functions of x only. There is no method always
effective; the main general result for such a linear equation is that
if any particular function of x, say y<span class="su">1</span>, can be discovered, for which</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr><td>d²y<span class="su">1</span></td> <td rowspan="2">+ P</td> <td>dy<span class="su">1</span></td> <td rowspan="2">+ Qy<span class="su">1</span> = 0,</td></tr>
<tr><td class="denom">dx²</td> <td class="denom">dx</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">then the substitution y = y<span class="su">1</span>&eta; in the original equation, with R on
the right side, reduces this to a linear equation of the first order with
the dependent variable d&eta;/dx. In fact, if y = y<span class="su">1</span>&eta; we have</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr><td>dy</td>
 <td rowspan="2">= y<span class="su">1</span></td> <td>d&eta;</td>
 <td rowspan="2">+ &eta;</td> <td>dy<span class="su">1</span></td>

<p class="noind">and thus</p>

<p class="noind">if then</p>

 <td rowspan="2">+ Qy<span class="su">1</span> = 0,</td></tr>

<p class="noind">and z denote d&eta;/dx, the original differential equation becomes</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">

<tr><td class="denom">dx</td> <td class="denom">dx</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">From this equation z can be found by the rule given above for
the linear equation of the first order, and will involve one arbitrary
constant; thence y = y<span class="su">1</span> &eta; = y<span class="su">1</span> &int; zdx + Ay<span class="su">1</span>,
where A is another arbitrary constant, will be the general solution of the original
equation, and, as was to be expected, involves two arbitrary
constants.</p>

<p>The case of most frequent occurrence is that in which the coefficients
P, Q are constants; we consider this case in some detail.
If &theta; be a root of the quadratic equation &theta;² + &theta;P + Q = 0, it can be at
once seen that a particular integral of the differential equation with
zero on the right side is y<span class="su">1</span> = e<span class="sp">&theta;x</span>. Supposing first the roots of the
quadratic equation to be different, and &phi; to be the other root, so that
&phi; + &theta; = -P, the auxiliary differential equation for z, referred to above,
becomes dz/dx + (&theta; &minus; &phi;)z = Re<span class="sp">-&theta;x</span>
which leads to ze<span class="sp">(&theta;-&phi;)</span> = B + &int; Re<span class="sp">-&theta;x</span>dx,
where B is an arbitrary constant, and hence to</p>

<p class="center">
y = Ae<span class="sp">&theta;<span class="sp"> x</span></span> + e<span class="sp">&theta;<span class="sp"> x</span></span> <span class="f150">&int;</span> Be<span class="sp">(&phi;-&theta;)<span class="sp"> x</span></span> dx + e<span class="sp">&theta;<span class="sp"> x</span></span> <span class="f150">&int;</span> e<span class="sp">(&phi;-&theta;)<span class="sp"> x</span></span> <span class="f150">&int;</span> Re<span class="sp">-&theta;<span class="sp"> x</span></span> dxdx,</p>

<p class="noind">or say to y = Ae<span class="sp">&theta;<span class="sp"> x</span></span> + Ce<span class="sp">&theta;<span class="sp"> x</span></span> + U,
where A, C are arbitrary constants and
U is a function of x, not present at all when R = 0. If the quadratic
equation &theta;² + P&theta; + Q = 0 has equal roots, so that 2&theta; = -P, the
auxiliary equation in z becomes dz/dx = Re<span class="sp">&theta;<span class="sp"> x</span></span>

the remaining terms in the complementary function will
similarly need alteration of form if there be other repeated roots.</p>

<p>To complete the solution of the differential equation we need some
method of determining a particular integral u; we explain a procedure
which is effective for this purpose in the cases in which R is
a sum of terms of the form e<span class="sp">ax</span>&phi;(x), where &phi;(x) is an integral polynomial
in x; this includes cases in which R contains terms of the
form cos bx·&phi;(x) or sin bx·&phi;(x). Denote d/dx by D; it is clear that if
u be any function of x,
D(e<span class="sp">ax</span>u) = e<span class="sp">ax</span>Du + ae<span class="sp">ax</span>u,
or say, D(e<span class="sp">ax</span>u) = e<span class="sp">ax</span>(D + a)u;
hence D²(e<span class="sp">ax</span>u), <i>i.e.</i> d²/dx² (e<span class="sp">ax</span>u), being equal to D(e<span class="sp">ax</span>v),
where v = (D + a)u, is equal to e<span class="sp">ax</span>(D + a)v, that is to e<span class="sp">ax</span>(D + a)²u.
In this way we find D<span class="sp">n</span>(e<span class="sp">ax</span>u) = e<span class="sp">ax</span>(D + a)<span class="sp">n</span>u, where n is any positive
integer. Hence if &psi;(D) be any polynomial in D with constant coefficients,
&psi;(D) (e<span class="sp">ax</span>u) = e<span class="sp">ax</span>&psi;(D + a)u.
Next, denoting &int; udx by  D<span class="sp">-1</span>u,
and any solution of the differential equation dz/dx + az = u by z = (d + a)<span class="sp">-1</span>u,
we have D[e<span class="sp">ax</span>(D + a)<span class="sp">-1</span>u] = D(e<span class="sp">ax</span>z) = e<span class="sp">ax</span>(D + a)z = e<span class="sp">ax</span>u,
so that we may write D<span class="sp">-1</span>(e<span class="sp">ax</span>u) = e<span class="sp">ax</span>(D + a)<span class="sp">-1</span>u,
where the meaning is that one value of the left side is equal to one value of the
right side; from this, the expression D<span class="sp">-2</span>(e<span class="sp">ax</span>u), which means
D<span class="sp">-1</span>[D<span class="sp">-1</span>(e<span class="sp">ax</span>u)],
is equal to D<span class="sp">-1</span>(e<span class="sp">ax</span>z) and hence to e<span class="sp">ax</span>(D + a)<span class="sp">-1</span>z,
which we write e<span class="sp">ax</span>(D + a)<span class="sp">-2</span>u; proceeding thus we obtain</p>

<p class="center">D<span class="sp">-n</span>(e<span class="sp">ax</span>u) = e<span class="sp">ax</span>(D + a)<span class="sp">-n</span>u,</p>

<p class="noind">where n is any positive integer, and the meaning, as before, is that
one value of the first expression is equal to one value of the second.
More generally, if &psi;(D) be any polynomial in D with constant coefficients,
and we agree to denote by [1/&psi;(D)]u any solution z of the
differential equation &psi;(D)z = u, we have, if v = [1/&psi;(D + a)]u, the identity
&psi;(D)(e<span class="sp">ax</span>v) = e<span class="sp">ax</span>&psi;(D + a)v = e<span class="sp">ax</span>u,
which we write in the form</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">

 <td rowspan="2">u.</td></tr>

<p class="noind">This gives us the first step in the method we are explaining,
namely that a solution of the differential equation

<p>It is now to be shown how to obtain one value of [1/&psi;(D + a)]u,
when u is a polynomial in x, namely one solution of the differential equation
&psi;(D + a)z = u. Let the highest power of x entering in u be x<span class="sp">m</span>; if t
were a variable quantity, the rational fraction in t, 1/&psi;(t + a) by first
writing it as a sum of partial fractions, or otherwise, could be identically
written in the form</p>

<p class="noind">where &phi;(t) is a polynomial in t; this shows that there exists an

<p class="noind">in this, since u contains no power of x higher than x<span class="sp">m</span>, the second

obtained by rule. We may have cases in which there are two
dependent variables, x and y, and one independent variable t, the

however, the two roots of the quadratic equation for &lambda; are equal,

equation, expressing x + &lambda;y in terms of t; by means of this equation
y can be eliminated from dx/dt = ax + by + c, leading to an equation
of the form dx/dt = Px + Q + Re<span class="sp">(a + &lambda;a&prime;)t</span>, where P, Q, R are constants.
The integration of this gives x, and thence y can be found.</p>

<p>A similar process is applicable when we have three or more

<p>Consider lastly a simple type of differential equation containing

determined, independent of one another, such that the equations
u = a, v = b, where a, b are arbitrary constants, lead to these ordinary

whose second row consists of the three quantities &part;u/&part;x, &part;u/&part;y, &part;u/&part;z,
whose third row consists similarly of the partial derivatives of v.
The vanishing of this so-called Jacobian determinant is known to
imply that F is expressible as a function of u and v, unless these are
themselves functionally related, which is contrary to hypothesis
(see the note below on Jacobian determinants). Conversely, any
relation &phi;(u, v) = 0 can easily be proved, in virtue of the equations
satisfied by u and v, to lead to</p>

made which is often of use in practice: when one equation u = a
has been found to satisfy the differential equations, we may utilize
this to obtain the second equation v = b; for instance, we may, by
means of u = a, eliminate z&mdash;when then from the resulting equations
in x and y a relation v = b has been found containing x and y and a,
the substitution a = u will give a relation involving x, y, z.</p>

<p><i>Note on Jacobian Determinants.</i>&mdash;The fact assumed above that the
vanishing of the Jacobian determinant whose elements are the partial
derivatives of three functions F, u, v, of three variables x, y, z,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>229</span>
involves that there exists a functional relation connecting the three
functions F, u, v, may be proved somewhat roughly as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The corresponding theorem is true for any number of variables.
Consider first the case of two functions p, q, of two variables x, y.
The function p, not being constant, must contain one of the variables,
say x; we can then suppose x expressed in terms of y and the function
p; thus the function q can be expressed in terms of y and the function
p, say q = Q(p, y). This is clear enough in the simplest cases which
arise, when the functions are rational. Hence we have</p>

<td class="denom">&part;y</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">these give</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr><td>&part;p</td> <td>&part;q</td> <td rowspan="2">&minus;</td>
<td>&part;p</td> <td>&part;q</td> <td rowspan="2">=</td>
<td>&part;p</td> <td>&part;Q</td> <td rowspan="2">;</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="ov">&part;x</td> <td class="ov">&part;y</td>
 <td class="ov">&part;y</td> <td class="ov">&part;x</td>
 <td class="ov">&part;x</td> <td class="ov">&part;y</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">by hypothesis &part;p/&part;x is not identically zero; therefore if the Jacobian
determinant of p and q in regard to x and y is zero identically, so is
&part;Q/&part;y, or Q does not contain y, so that q is expressible as a function
of p only. Conversely, such an expression can be seen at once to
make the Jacobian of p and q vanish identically.</p>

<p>Passing now to the case of three variables, suppose that the
Jacobian determinant of the three functions F, u, v in regard to
x, y, z is identically zero. We prove that if u, v are not themselves
functionally connected, F is expressible as a function of u and v.
Suppose first that the minors of the elements of &part;F/&part;x, &part;F/&part;y, &part;F/&part;z
in the determinant are all identically zero, namely the three determinants
such as</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr><td>&part;u</td> <td>&part;v</td> <td rowspan="2">&minus;</td>
<td>&part;u</td> <td>&part;v</td> <td rowspan="2">;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ov">&part;y</td> <td class="ov">&part;z</td>
<td class="ov">&part;z</td> <td class="ov">&part;y</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">then by the case of two variables considered above there exist three
functional relations. &psi;<span class="su">1</span>(u, v, x) = 0, &psi;<span class="su">2</span>(u, v, y) = 0, &psi;<span class="su">3</span>(u, v, z) = 0, of which
the first, for example, follows from the vanishing of</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr><td>&part;u</td> <td>&part;v</td> <td rowspan="2">&minus;</td>
<td>&part;u</td> <td>&part;v</td> <td rowspan="2">.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ov">&part;y</td> <td class="ov">&part;z</td>
<td class="ov">&part;z</td> <td class="ov">&part;y</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">We cannot assume that x is absent from &psi;<span class="su">1</span>, or y from &psi;<span class="su">2</span>, or z from &psi;<span class="su">3</span>;
but conversely we cannot simultaneously have x entering in &psi;<span class="su">1</span>, and
y in &psi;<span class="su">2</span>, and z in &psi;<span class="su">3</span>, or else by elimination of u and v from the three
equations &psi;<span class="su">1</span> = 0, &psi;<span class="su">2</span> = 0, &psi;<span class="su">3</span> = 0, we should find a necessary relation
connecting the three independent quantities x, y, z; which is absurd.
Thus when the three minors of &part;F/&part;x, &part;F/&part;y, &part;F/&part;z in the Jacobian
determinant are all zero, there exists a functional relation connecting
u and v only. Suppose no such relation to exist; we can then
suppose, for example, that</p>

<p class="noind">is not zero. Then from the equations u(x, y, z) = u, v(x, y, z) = v we can
express y and z in terms of u, v, and x (the attempt to do this could
only fail by leading to a relation connecting u, v and x, and the
existence of such a relation would involve that the determinant</p>

<p class="center pt2"><i>Part II.&mdash;General Theory.</i></p>

<p>Differential equations arise in the expression of the relations
between quantities by the elimination of details, either unknown
or regarded as unessential to the formulation of the relations in
question. They give rise, therefore, to the two closely connected
problems of determining what arrangement of details is consistent
with them, and of developing, apart from these details, the general
properties expressed by them. Very roughly, two methods of
study can be distinguished, with the names Transformation-theories,
Function-theories; the former is concerned with the
reduction of the algebraical relations to the fewest and simplest
forms, eventually with the hope of obtaining explicit expressions
of the dependent variables in terms of the independent variables;
the latter is concerned with the determination of the general
descriptive relations among the quantities which are involved by
the differential equations, with as little use of algebraical calculations
as may be possible. Under the former heading we may,
with the assumption of a few theorems belonging to the latter,
arrange the theory of partial differential equations and Pfaff&rsquo;s
problem, with their geometrical interpretations, as at present
developed, and the applications of Lie&rsquo;s theory of transformation-groups
to partial and to ordinary equations; under the
latter, the study of linear differential equations in the manner
initiated by Riemann, the applications of discontinuous groups,
the theory of the singularities of integrals, and the study of
potential equations with existence-theorems arising therefrom.
In order to be clear we shall enter into some detail in regard
to partial differential equations of the first order, both those
which are linear in any number of variables and those not
linear in two independent variables, and also in regard to the
function-theory of linear differential equations of the second
order. Space renders impossible anything further than the
briefest account of many other matters; in particular, the theories
of partial equations of higher than the first order, the function-theory
of the singularities of ordinary equations not linear and the
applications to differential geometry, are taken account of only in
the bibliography. It is believed that on the whole the article will
be more useful to the reader than if explanations of method had
been further curtailed to include more facts.</p>

<p>When we speak of a function without qualification, it is to be
understood that in the immediate neighbourhood of a particular
set x<span class="su">0</span>, y<span class="su">0</span>, ... of values of the independent variables x, y, ...
of the function, at whatever point of the range of values for
x, y, ... under consideration x<span class="su">0</span>, y<span class="su">0</span>, ... may be chosen, the
function can be expressed as a series of positive integral powers
of the differences x &minus; x<span class="su">0</span>, y &minus; y<span class="su">0</span>, ..., convergent when these are
sufficiently small (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Function: Functions of Complex Variables</a></span>).
Without this condition, which we express by saying that
the function is developable about x<span class="su">0</span>, y<span class="su">0</span>, ..., many results
provisionally stated in the transformation theories would be
unmeaning or incorrect. If, then, we have a set of k functions,
&fnof;<span class="su">1</span> ... &fnof;<span class="su">k</span> of n independent variables x<span class="su">1</span> ... x<span class="su">n</span>, we say that
they are independent when n &ge; k and not every determinant of
k rows and columns vanishes of the matrix of k rows and n
columns whose r-th row has the constituents d&fnof;<span class="su">r</span>/dx<span class="su">1</span>, ... d&fnof;<span class="su">r</span>/dx<span class="su">n</span>;
the justification being in the theorem, which we assume, that if
the determinant involving, for instance, the first k columns be not
zero for x<span class="su">1</span> = xº<span class="su">1</span> ... x<span class="su">n</span> = xº<span class="su">n</span>, and the functions be developable
about this point, then from the equations &fnof;<span class="su">1</span> = c<span class="su">1</span>, ... &fnof;<span class="su">k</span> = c<span class="su">k</span> we
can express x<span class="su">1</span>, ... x<span class="su">k</span> by convergent power series in the
differences x<span class="su">k+1</span> &minus; xº<span class="su">k+1</span>, ... x<span class="su">n</span> &minus; x<span class="su">nº</span>, and so regard x<span class="su">1</span>, ... x<span class="su">k</span>
as functions of the remaining variables. This we often express by
saying that the equations &fnof;<span class="su">1</span> = c<span class="su">1</span>, ... &fnof;<span class="su">k</span> = c<span class="su">k</span> can be solved for
x<span class="su">1</span>, ... x<span class="su">k</span>. The explanation is given as a type of explanation
often understood in what follows.</p>

<p>We may conveniently begin by stating the theorem: If each of
the n functions &phi;<span class="su">1</span>, ... &phi;<span class="su">n</span> of the (n + 1) variables x<span class="su">1</span>, ... x<span class="su">n</span>t be developable
<span class="sidenote">Ordinary equations of the first order.</span>
about the values xº<span class="su">1</span>, ... x<span class="su">n</span><span class="sp">0</span>t<span class="sp">0</span>, the n differential
equations of the form dx<span class="su">1</span>/dt = &phi;<span class="su">1</span>(tx<span class="su">1</span>, ... x<span class="su">n</span>) are satisfied
by convergent power series</p>

<p class="center">x<span class="su">r</span> = xº<span class="su">r</span> + (t &minus; t<span class="sp">0</span>) A<span class="su">r1</span> + (t &minus; t<span class="su">0</span>)² A<span class="su">r2</span> + ...</p>

<p class="noind">reducing respectively to xº<span class="su">1</span>, ... xº<span class="su">n</span> when t = t<span class="sp">0</span>; and the
only functions satisfying the equations and reducing respectively to
xº<span class="su">1</span>, ... xº<span class="su">n</span> when t = t<span class="sp">0</span>, are those determined by continuation of these
series. If the result of solving these n equations for xº<span class="su">1</span>, ... xº<span class="su">n</span> be
written in the form &omega;<span class="su">1</span>(x<span class="su">1</span>, ... x<span class="su">n</span>t) = xº<span class="su">1</span>, ... &omega;<span class="su">n</span>(x<span class="su">1</span>, ... x<span class="su">n</span>t) = xº<span class="su">n</span>,
<span class="sidenote">Single homogeneous partial equation of the first order.</span>
it is at once evident that the differential equation</p>

<p class="noind">possesses n integrals, namely, the functions &omega;<span class="su">1</span>, ... &omega;<span class="su">n</span>,
which are developable about the values (xº<span class="su">1</span> ... x<span class="su">n</span><span class="sp">0</span>t<span class="sp">0</span>) and
reduce respectively to x<span class="su">1</span>, ... x<span class="su">n</span> when t = t<span class="sp">0</span>. And in fact it
has no other integrals so reducing. Thus this equation
also possesses a unique integral reducing when t = t<span class="sp">0</span> to an arbitrary
function &psi;(x<span class="su">1</span>, ... x<span class="su">n</span>), this integral being. &psi;(&omega;<span class="su">1</span>, ... &omega;<span class="su">n</span>). Conversely
the existence of these <i>principal</i> integrals &omega;<span class="su">1</span>, ... &omega;<span class="su">n</span> of the partial
equation establishes the existence of the specified solutions of the
ordinary equations dx<span class="su">i</span>/dt = &phi;<span class="su">i</span>. The following sketch of the proof of
the existence of these principal integrals for the case n = 2 will show
the character of more general investigations. Put x for x &minus; x<span class="sp">0</span>, &amp;c.,
and consider the equation a(xyt) d&fnof;/dx + b(xyt) d&fnof;/dy = d&fnof;/dt, wherein

coefficients of the coefficients in P<span class="su">s</span>, P<span class="su">s-1</span>, ..., P<span class="su">0</span> and the coefficients
in A and B; and they are the same aggregates as would be given by
the previously obtained equations for the corresponding coefficients

in a and b. Hence as the coefficients in P<span class="su">0</span> and also in A, B
are real and positive, it follows that the values obtained in succession
for the coefficients in P<span class="su">1</span>, P<span class="su">2</span>, ... are real and positive; and further,
taking account of the fact that the absolute value of a sum of terms
is not greater than the sum of the absolute values of the terms, it
follows, for each value of s, that every coefficient in p<span class="su">s+1</span> is, in absolute
value, not greater than the corresponding coefficient in P<span class="su">s+1</span>. Thus
if the series for F be convergent, the series for &fnof; will also be; and we
are thus reduced to (1), specifying functions A, B with real positive
coefficients, each in absolute value not less than the corresponding
coefficient in a, b; (2) proving that the equation</p>

<p class="noind">and that this solves the problem when x, y, t are sufficiently small
for the two cases p<span class="su">0</span> = x, p<span class="su">0</span> = y. One obvious application of the
general theorem is to the proof of the existence of an integral of
an ordinary linear differential equation given by the n equations
dy/dx = y<span class="su">1</span>, dy<span class="su">1</span>/dx = y<span class="su">2</span>, ...,</p>

<p class="center">dy<span class="su">n-1</span>/dx = p &minus; p<span class="su">1</span>y<span class="su">n-1</span> &minus; ... &minus; p<span class="su">n</span>y;</p>

<p class="noind">but in fact any simultaneous system of ordinary equations is reducible
to a system of the form</p>

<p class="center">dx<span class="su">i</span>/dt = &phi;<span class="su">i</span>(tx<span class="su">1</span>, ... x<span class="su">n</span>).</p>

<p>Suppose we have k homogeneous linear partial equations of the
first order in n independent variables, the general equation being
a<span class="su">&sigma;1</span>d&fnof;/dx<span class="su">1</span> + ... + a<span class="su">&sigma;n</span>d&fnof;/dx<span class="su">n</span> = 0,
where &sigma; = 1, ... k, and that
<span class="sidenote">Simultaneous linear partial equations.</span>
we desire to know whether the equations have common
solutions, and if so, how many. It is to be understood
that the equations are linearly independent, which implies
that k &le; n and not every determinant of k rows and columns
is identically zero in the matrix in which the i-th element of the &sigma;-th
row is a<span class="su">&sigma;i</span>}(i = 1, ... n, &sigma; = 1, ... k). Denoting the left side of the
&sigma;-th equation by P&sigma;&fnof;, it is clear that every common solution of the
two equations P<span class="su">&sigma;</span>&fnof; = 0, P<span class="su">&rho;</span>&fnof; = 0,
is also a solution of the equation
P<span class="su">&rho;</span>(p<span class="su">&sigma;</span>&fnof;), P<span class="su">&sigma;</span>(p<span class="su">&rho;</span>&fnof;),
We immediately find, however, that this is
also a linear equation, namely, &Sigma;H<span class="su">i</span>d&fnof;/dx<span class="su">i</span> = 0
where H<span class="su">i</span> = P<span class="su">&rho;</span>a<span class="su">&sigma;</span> &minus; P<span class="su">&sigma;</span>a<span class="su">&rho;</span>,
and if it be not already contained among the given equations, or be
linearly deducible from them, it may be added to them, as not introducing
any additional limitation of the possibility of their having
common solutions. Proceeding thus with every pair of the original
equations, and then with every pair of the possibly augmented
system so obtained, and so on continually, we shall arrive at a
system of equations, linearly independent of each other and therefore
not more than n in number, such that the combination, in the way
described, of every pair of them, leads to an equation which is
linearly deducible from them. If the number of this so-called
<i>complete system</i> is n, the equations give d&fnof;/dx<span class="su">1</span> = 0 ... d&fnof;/dx<span class="su">n</span> = 0,
leading to the nugatory result &fnof; = a constant. Suppose, then, the
number of this system to be r &lt; n; suppose, further, that from the
<span class="sidenote">Complete systems of linear partial equations.</span>
matrix of the coefficients a determinant of r rows and
columns not vanishing identically is that formed by the
coefficients of the differential coefficients of &fnof; in regard
to x<span class="su">1</span> ... x<span class="su">r</span>; also that the coefficients are all developable
about the values x<span class="su">1</span> = xº<span class="su">1</span>, ... x<span class="su">n</span>= xº<span class="su">n</span>, and that for these
values the determinant just spoken of is not zero.
Then the main theorem is that the complete system of r equations,
and therefore the originally given set of k equations,
have in common n &minus; r solutions, say &omega;<span class="su">r+1</span>, ... &omega;<span class="su">n</span>, which reduce
respectively to x<span class="su">r+1</span>, ... x<span class="su">n</span> when in them for x<span class="su">1</span>, ... x<span class="su">r</span> are respectively
put xº<span class="su">1</span>, ... xº<span class="su">r</span>; so that also the equations have in common a
solution reducing when x<span class="su">1</span> = xº<span class="su">1</span>, ... x<span class="su">r</span> = xº<span class="su">r</span> to an arbitrary function
&psi;(x<span class="su">r+1</span>, ... x<span class="su">n</span>) which is developable about xº<span class="su">r+1</span>, ... xº<span class="su">n</span>, namely,
this common solution is &psi;(&omega;<span class="su">r+1</span>, ... &omega;<span class="su">n</span>). It is seen at once
that this result is a generalization of the theorem for r = 1, and its
proof is conveniently given by induction from that case. It can be
verified without difficulty (1) that if from the r equations of the
complete system we form r independent linear aggregates, with
coefficients not necessarily constants, the new system is also a complete
system; (2) that if in place of the independent variables
x<span class="su">1</span>, ... x<span class="su">n</span> we introduce any other variables which are independent
functions of the former, the new equations also form a complete
system. It is convenient, then, from the complete system of r
equations to form r new equations by solving separately for d&fnof;/dx<span class="su">1</span>, ...,
d&fnof;/dx<span class="su">r</span>; suppose the general equation of the new system to be</p>

<p class="center">Q<span class="su">&sigma;</span>&fnof; = d&fnof;/dx<span class="su">&sigma;</span> + c<span class="su">&sigma;jr+1</span>d&fnof;/dx<span class="su">r+1</span> + ... + c<span class="su">&sigma;n</span>d&fnof;/dx<span class="su">n</span> = 0 (&sigma; = 1, ... r).</p>

<p class="noind">Then it is easily obvious that the equation Q<span class="su">&rho;</span>Q<span class="su">&sigma;</span>&fnof; &minus; Q<span class="su">&sigma;</span>Q<span class="su">&rho;</span>&fnof; = 0
contains only the differential coefficients of &fnof; in regard to x<span class="su">r+1</span> ... x<span class="su">n</span>; as
it is at most a linear function of Q<span class="su">1</span>&fnof;, ... Q<span class="su">r</span>&fnof;, it must be identically
zero. So reduced the system is called a Jacobian system. Of this
system Q<span class="su">1</span>&fnof;=0 has n &minus; 1 principal solutions reducing respectively
<span class="sidenote">Jacobian systems.</span>
to x<span class="su">2</span>, ... x<span class="su">n</span> when</p>

<p class="center">x<span class="su">1</span> = xº<span class="su">1</span>,</p>

<p class="noind">and its form shows that of these the first r &minus; 1 are exactly x<span class="su">2</span> ... x<span class="su">r</span>.
Let these n &minus; 1 functions together with x<span class="su">1</span> be introduced as n new
independent variables in all the r equations. Since the first equation
is satisfied by n &minus; 1 of the new independent variables, it will contain
no differential coefficients in regard to them, and will reduce therefore
simply to d&fnof;/dx<span class="su">1</span> = 0, expressing that any common solution of the r
equations is a function only of the n &minus; 1 remaining variables. Thereby
the investigation of the common solutions is reduced to the same
problem for r &minus; 1 equations in n &minus; 1 variables. Proceeding thus, we
reach at length one equation in n &minus; r + 1 variables, from which, by
retracing the analysis, the proposition stated is seen to follow.</p>

<p>The analogy with the case of one equation is, however, still closer.
With the coefficients c<span class="su">&sigma;j</span>, of the equations Q<span class="su">&sigma;</span>&fnof; = 0 in transposed
array (&sigma; = 1, ... r, j = r + 1, ... n) we can put down the
(n &minus; r) equations, dx<span class="su">j</span> = c<span class="su">1j</span>dx<span class="su">1</span> + ... + c<span class="su">rj</span>dx<span class="su">r</span>, equivalent to
<span class="sidenote">System of total differential equations.</span>
the r(n &minus; r) equations dx<span class="su">j</span>/dx<span class="su">&sigma;</span> = c<span class="su">&sigma;r</span>. That consistent
with them we may be able to regard x<span class="su">r+1</span>, ... x<span class="su">n</span> as
functions of x<span class="su">1</span>, ... x<span class="su">r</span>, these being regarded as independent
variables, it is clearly necessary that when we differentiate c<span class="su">&sigma;j</span> in
regard to x<span class="su">&rho;</span> on this hypothesis the result should be the same as when
we differentiate c<span class="su">&rho;j</span>, in regard to x<span class="su">&sigma;</span> on this hypothesis. The differential
coefficient of a function &fnof; of x<span class="su">1</span>, ... x<span class="su">n</span> on this hypothesis, in
regard to x<span class="su">&rho;j</span> is, however,</p>

<p class="center">d&fnof;/dx<span class="su">&rho;</span> + c<span class="su">&rho;jr+1</span>d&fnof;/dx<span class="su">r+1</span> + ... + c<span class="su">&rho;n</span>d&fnof;/dx<span class="su">n</span>,</p>

<p class="noind">namely, is Q<span class="su">&rho;</span>&fnof;. Thus the consistence of the n &minus; r total equations
requires the conditions Q<span class="su">&rho;</span>c<span class="su">&sigma;j</span> &minus; Q<span class="su">&sigma;</span>c<span class="su">&rho;j</span> = 0, which are, however,
verified in virtue of Q<span class="su">&rho;</span>(Q<span class="su">&sigma;</span>&fnof;) &minus; Q<span class="su">&sigma;</span>(Q<span class="su">&rho;</span>&fnof;) = 0. And it can in fact be
easily verified that if &omega;<span class="su">r+1</span>, ... &omega;<span class="su">n</span> be the principal solutions of the
Jacobian system, Q<span class="su">&sigma;</span>&fnof; = 0, reducing respectively to x<span class="su">r+1</span>, ... x<span class="su">n</span> when
x<span class="su">1</span> = xº<span class="su">1</span>, ... x<span class="su">r</span> = xº<span class="su">r</span>, and the equations &omega;<span class="su">r+1</span> = x<span class="sp">0</span><span class="su">r+1</span>, ... &omega;<span class="su">n</span> = xº<span class="su">n</span>
be solved for x<span class="su">r+1</span>, ... x<span class="su">n</span> to give x<span class="su">j</span> = &psi;<span class="su">j</span>(x<span class="su">1</span>, ... x<span class="su">r</span>, x<span class="sp">0</span><span class="su">r+1</span>, ... xº<span class="su">n</span>), these
values solve the total equations and reduce respectively to x<span class="sp">0</span><span class="su">r+1</span>, ... xº<span class="su">n</span>
when x<span class="su">1</span> = xº<span class="su">1</span> ... x<span class="su">r</span> = xº<span class="su">r</span>. And the total equations have no
other solutions with these initial values. Conversely, the existence
of these solutions of the total equations can be deduced a priori
and the theory of the Jacobian system based upon them. The
theory of such total equations, in general, finds its natural place
under the heading <i>Pfaffian Expressions</i>, below.</p>

<p>A practical method of reducing the solution of the r equations
of a Jacobian system to that of a single equation in n &minus; r + 1 variables
may be explained in connexion with a geometrical interpretation
which will perhaps be clearer in a particular
<span class="sidenote">Geometrical interpretation and solution.</span>
case, say n = 3, r = 2. There is then only one total
equation, say dz = adz + bdy; if we do not take account
of the condition of integrability, which is in this case
da/dy + bda/dz = db/dx + adb/dz, this equation may be regarded
as defining through an arbitrary point (x<span class="su">0</span>, y<span class="su">0</span>, z<span class="su">0</span>) of three-dimensioned
space (about which a, b are developable) a plane, namely,

point &infin;<span class="sp">2</span> directions, namely, all those in the plane. If now there be
a surface z = &psi;(x, y), satisfying dz = adz + bdy and passing through
(x<span class="su">0</span>, y<span class="su">0</span>, z<span class="su">0</span>), this plane will touch the surface, and the operations of

<p class="noind">and then to (x<span class="su">0</span> + dx<span class="su">0</span>, y<span class="su">0</span> + dy<span class="su">0</span>, Z<span class="su">0</span> + d<span class="sp">1</span>z<span class="su">0</span>), ought to lead to the same

<p class="noind">namely, &delta;<span class="sp">1</span>z<span class="su">0</span> ought to be equal to d<span class="sp">1</span>z<span class="su">0</span>. But we find</p>

(2) that if the quantity au<span class="su">23</span> + bu<span class="su">31</span> + cu<span class="su">12</span> is identically zero, the expression
is of the form udt, <i>i.e.</i> it can be made a perfect differential
by multiplication by the factor 1/u; (3) that in general the expression
is of the form dt + u<span class="su">1</span>dt<span class="su">1</span>. Consider the matrix of four
rows and three columns, in which the elements of the first row are
a, b, c, and the elements of the (r + 1)-th row, for r = 1, 2, 3, are the
quantities u<span class="su">r1</span>, u<span class="su">r2</span>, u<span class="su">r3</span>, where u<span class="su">11</span> = u<span class="su">22</span> = u<span class="su">33</span> = 0. Then it is easily
seen that the cases (1), (2), (3) above correspond respectively to the
cases when (1) every determinant of this matrix of two rows and
columns is zero, (2) every determinant of three rows and columns
is zero, (3) when no condition is assumed. This result can be generalized
as follows: if a<span class="su">1</span>, ... a<span class="su">n</span> be any functions of x<span class="su">1</span>, ... x<span class="su">n</span>, the so-called
Pfaffian expression a<span class="su">1</span>dx<span class="su">1</span> + ... + a<span class="su">n</span>dx<span class="su">n</span> can be reduced to one
or other of the two forms</p>

<p class="center">u<span class="su">1</span>dt<span class="su">1</span> + ... + u<span class="su">k</span>dt<span class="su">k</span>, dt + u<span class="su">1</span>dt<span class="su">1</span> +  ... + u<span class="su">k-1</span>dt<span class="su">k-1</span>,</p>

<p class="noind">wherein t, u<span class="su">1</span> ..., t<span class="su">1</span>, ... are independent functions of x<span class="su">1</span>, ... x<span class="su">n</span>, and k
is such that in these two cases respectively 2k or 2k &minus; 1 is the rank of
a certain matrix of n + 1 rows and n columns, that is, the greatest
number of rows and columns in a non-vanishing determinant of the
matrix; the matrix is that whose first row is constituted by the
quantities a<span class="su">1</span>, ... a<span class="su">n</span>, whose s-th element in the (r + 1)-th row is the
quantity da<span class="su">r</span>/dx<span class="su">s</span> &minus; da<span class="su">s</span>/dx<span class="su">r</span>. The proof of such a reduced form can
be obtained from the two results: (1) If t be any given function
of the 2m independent variables u<span class="su">1</span>, ... u<span class="su">m</span>, t<span class="su">1</span>, ... t<span class="su">m</span>, the expression
dt + u<span class="su">1</span>dt<span class="su">1</span> +  ... + u<span class="su">m</span>dt<span class="su">m</span> can be put into the form u&prime;<span class="su">1</span>dt&prime;<span class="su">1</span> + ...  + u&prime;<span class="su">m</span>dt&prime;<span class="su">m</span>.
(2) If the quantities u<span class="su">1</span>, ..., u<span class="su">1</span>, t<span class="su">1</span>, ... t<span class="su">m</span> be connected by a relation,
the expression n<span class="su">1</span>dt<span class="su">1</span> +  ... + u<span class="su">m</span>dt<span class="su">m</span> can be put into the format dt&prime; + u&prime;<span class="su">1</span>dt&prime;<span class="su">1</span>
 + ... + u&prime;<span class="su">m-1</span>dt&prime;<span class="su">m-1</span>; and if the relation connecting u<span class="su">1</span>,  u<span class="su">m</span>, t<span class="su">1</span>, ... t<span class="su">m</span>
be homogeneous in u<span class="su">1</span>, ... u<span class="su">m</span>, then t&prime; can be taken to be zero. These
two results are deductions from the theory of <i>contact transformations</i>
(see below), and their demonstration requires, beside elementary
algebraical considerations, only the theory of complete systems of
linear homogeneous partial differential equations of the first order.
When the existence of the reduced form of the Pfaffian expression
containing only independent quantities is thus once assured, the
identification of the number k with that defined by the specified
matrix may, with some difficulty, be made <i>a posteriori</i>.</p>

<p>In all cases of a single Pfaffian equation we are thus led to consider
what is implied by a relation dt &minus; u<span class="su">1</span>dt<span class="su">1</span> &minus; ... &minus; u<span class="su">m</span>dt<span class="su">m</span> = 0, in which
t, u<span class="su">1</span>, ... u<span class="su">m</span>, t<span class="su">1</span> ..., t<span class="su">m</span> are, except for this equation,
independent variables. This is to be satisfied in virtue of
<span class="sidenote">Single linear Pfaffian equation.</span>
one or several relations connecting the variables; these
must involve relations connecting t, t<span class="su">1</span>, ... t<span class="su">m</span> only, and
in one of these at least t must actually enter. We can
then suppose that in one actual system of relations in virtue of which
the Pfaffian equation is satisfied, all the relations connecting t, t<span class="su">1</span> ...
t<span class="su">m</span> only are given by</p>

<p class="center">t = &psi;(t<span class="su">s+1</span> ... t<span class="su">m</span>), t<span class="su">1</span> = &psi;<span class="su">1</span>(t<span class="su">s+1</span> ... t<span class="su">m</span>), ... t<span class="su">s</span> = &psi;<span class="su">s</span>(t<span class="su">s+1</span> ... t<span class="su">m</span>);</p>

<p class="noind">so that the equation</p>

<p class="center">d&psi; &minus; u<span class="su">1</span>d&psi;<span class="su">1</span> &minus; ... &minus; u<span class="su">s</span>d&psi;<span class="su">s</span> &minus; u<span class="su">s+1</span>dt<span class="su">s+1</span> &minus; ... &minus; u<span class="su">m</span>dt<span class="su">m</span> = 0</p>

<p class="noind">is identically true in regard to u<span class="su">1</span>, ... u<span class="su">m</span>, t<span class="su">s+1</span> ..., t<span class="su">m</span>; equating to
zero the coefficients of the differentials of these variables, we thus
obtain m &minus; s relations of the form</p>

<p class="center">d&psi;/dt<span class="su">j</span> &minus; u<span class="su">1</span>d&psi;<span class="su">1</span>/dt<span class="su">j</span> &minus; ... &minus; u<span class="su">s</span>d&psi;<span class="su">s</span>/dt<span class="su">j</span> &minus; u<span class="su">j</span> = 0;</p>

<p class="noind">these m &minus; s relations, with the previous s + 1 relations, constitute a set
of m + 1 relations connecting the 2m + 1 variables in virtue of which
the Pfaffian equation is satisfied independently of the form of the
functions &psi;,&psi;<span class="su">1</span>, ... &psi;<span class="su">s</span>. There is clearly such a set for each of the
values s = 0, s = 1, ..., s = m &minus; 1, s = m. And for any value of s there
may exist relations additional to the specified m + 1 relations, provided
they do not involve any relation connecting t, t<span class="su">1</span>, ... t<span class="su">m</span> only,
and are consistent with the m &minus; s relations connecting u<span class="su">1</span>, ... u<span class="su">m</span>. It
is now evident that, essentially, the integration of a Pfaffian equation</p>

<p class="center">a<span class="su">1</span>dx<span class="su">1</span> + ... + a<span class="su">n</span>dx<span class="su">n</span> = 0,</p>

<p class="noind">wherein a<span class="su">1</span>, ... a<span class="su">n</span> are functions of x<span class="su">1</span>, ... x<span class="su">n</span>, is effected by the
processes necessary to bring it to its reduced form, involving only
independent variables. And it is easy to see that if we suppose this
reduction to be carried out in all possible ways, there is no need to
distinguish the classes of integrals corresponding to the various
values of s; for it can be verified without difficulty that by putting
t&prime; = t &minus; u<span class="su">1</span>t<span class="su">1</span> &minus; ... &minus; u<span class="su">s</span>t<span class="su">s</span>, t&prime;<span class="su">1</span> = u<span class="su">1</span>, ... t&prime;<span class="su">s</span> = u<span class="su">s</span>, u&prime;<span class="su">1</span> = &minus;t<span class="su">1</span>, ..., u&prime;<span class="su">s</span> = &minus;t<span class="su">s</span>,
t&prime;<span class="su">s+1</span> = t<span class="su">s+1</span>, ... t&prime;<span class="su">m</span> = t<span class="su">m</span>, u&prime;<span class="su">s+1</span> = u<span class="su">s+1</span>, ... u&prime;<span class="su">m</span> = u<span class="su">m</span>,
the reduced equation
becomes changed to dt&prime; &minus; u&prime;<span class="su">1</span>dt&prime;<span class="su">1</span> &minus;  ... &minus; u&prime;<span class="su">m</span>dt&prime;<span class="su">m</span> = 0, and the general
relations changed to</p>

<p class="center">t&prime; = &psi;(t&prime;<span class="su">s+1</span>, ... t&prime;<span class="su">m</span>) &minus; t&prime;<span class="su">1</span>&psi;<span class="su">1</span>(t&prime;<span class="su">s+1</span>, ... t&prime;<span class="su">m</span>) &minus;  ... &minus; t&prime;<span class="su">s</span>&psi;<span class="su">s</span>(t&prime;<span class="su">s+1</span>, ... t&prime;<span class="su">m</span>), = &phi;,</p>

<p class="noind">say, together with u&prime;<span class="su">1</span> = d&phi;/dt&prime;<span class="su">1</span>, ..., u&prime;<span class="su">m</span> = d&phi;/dt&prime;<span class="su">m</span>, which contain only
one relation connecting the variables t&prime;, t&prime;<span class="su">1</span>, ... t&prime;<span class="su">m</span> only.</p>

<p>This method for a single Pfaffian equation can, strictly speaking,
be generalized to a simultaneous system of (n &minus; r) Pfaffian equations
dx<span class="su">j</span> = c<span class="su">1j</span>dx<span class="su">1</span> +  ...  + c<span class="su">rj</span>dx<span class="su">r</span> only in the case already treated,
<span class="sidenote">Simultaneous Pfaffian equations.</span>
when this system is satisfied by regarding x<span class="su">r+1</span>, ... x<span class="su">n</span> as
suitable functions of the independent variables x<span class="su">1</span>, ... x<span class="su">r</span>;
in that case the integral manifolds are of r dimensions.
When these are non-existent, there may be integral manifolds
of higher dimensions; for if</p>

<p class="center">d&phi; = &phi;<span class="su">1</span>dx<span class="su">1</span> +  ... + &phi;<span class="su">r</span>dx<span class="su">r</span> + &phi;<span class="su">r+1</span>(c<span class="su">1,r+1</span>dx<span class="su">1</span> +  ...  + c<span class="su">r,r+1</span>dx<span class="su">r</span>) + &phi;<span class="su">r+2</span>(&emsp;) +  ...</p>

<p class="noind">be identically zero, then &phi;&sigma; + c&sigma;,<span class="su">r+1</span>&phi;<span class="su">r+1</span> +  ... + c&sigma;,<span class="su">n</span>&phi;<span class="su">n</span> &asymp; 0, or &phi; satisfies
the r partial differential equations previously associated with the
total equations; when these are not a complete system, but included
in a complete system of r &minus; &mu; equations, having therefore
n &minus; r &minus; &mu; independent integrals, the total equations are satisfied over
a manifold of r + &mu; dimensions (see E. v. Weber, <i>Math. Annal.</i> 1v.
(1901), p. 386).</p>

<p>It seems desirable to add here certain results, largely of algebraic
character, which naturally arise in connexion with the theory of
contact transformations. For any two functions of the 2n
<span class="sidenote">Contact transformations.</span>
independent variables x<span class="su">1</span>, ... x<span class="su">n</span>, p<span class="su">1</span>, ... p<span class="su">n</span> we denote by (&phi;&psi;)
the sum of the n terms such as d&phi;d&psi;/dp<span class="su">i</span>dx<span class="su">i</span> &minus; d&psi;d&phi;/dp<span class="su">i</span>dx<span class="su">i</span> For two
functions of the (2n + 1) independent variables z, x<span class="su">1</span>, ... x<span class="su">n</span>, p<span class="su">1</span>, ... p<span class="su">n</span>
we denote by &phi;&psi; the sum of the n terms such as</p>

<p class="noind">It can at once be verified that for any three functions [&fnof;[&phi;&psi;]] + [&phi;[&psi;&fnof;]]

shown by elementary algebra, after equating coefficients of independent

functions of the 2n variables x<span class="su">1</span>, ... p<span class="su">n</span>, so that the equations

therefore a transformation, which we call a homogeneous contact
transformation; (2) that the X<span class="su">1</span>, ... X<span class="su">n</span> are homogeneous functions of
p<span class="su">1</span>, ... p<span class="su">n</span> of zero dimensions, the P<span class="su">1</span>, ... P<span class="su">n</span> are homogeneous functions

<p>Finally, there is a particular case of great importance arising when
&sigma; = 1, which gives the results: (1) If U, X<span class="su">1</span>, ... X<span class="su">n</span>, P<span class="su">1</span>, ... P<span class="su">n</span> be

this differential identity when U is an arbitrary given function of

such that (X&sigma;U) = &delta;X&sigma;, (X&rho;X&sigma;) = 0, for &rho;, &sigma; = 1 ... r, then
the r + 1 homogeneous linear partial differential equations of the
first order (U&fnof;) + &delta;&fnof; = 0, (X&rho;&fnof;) = 0, form a complete system. It will
be seen that the assumptions above made for the reduction of
Pfaffian expressions follow from the results here enunciated for
contact transformations.</p>

<p>We pass on now to consider the solution of any partial
differential equation of the first order; we attempt to explain
certain ideas relatively to a single equation with any
number of independent variables (in particular, an
<span class="sidenote">Partial differential equation of the first order.</span>
ordinary equation of the first order with one independent
variable) by speaking of a single equation with
two independent variables x, y, and one dependent
variable z. It will be seen that we are naturally led to
consider systems of such simultaneous equations, which we
consider below. The central discovery of the transformation
theory of the solution of an equation F(x, y, z, dz/dx, dz/dy) = 0
is that its solution can always be reduced to the solution of
partial equations which are <i>linear</i>. For this, however, we must
regard dz/dx, dz/dy, during the process of integration, not as the
differential coefficients of a function z in regard to x and y, but as
variables independent of x, y, z, the too great indefiniteness that
might thus appear to be introduced being provided for in another
way. We notice that if z = &psi;(x, y) be a solution of the differential
equation, then dz = dxd&psi;/dx + dyd&psi;/dy; thus if we denote
the equation by F(x, y, z, p, q,) = 0, and prescribe the condition
dz = pdx + qdy for every solution, any solution such as z = &psi;(x, y)
will necessarily be associated with the equations p = dz/dx,
q = dz/dy, and z will satisfy the equation in its original form. We
have previously seen (under <i>Pfaffian Expressions</i>) that if five
variables x, y, z, p, q, otherwise independent, be subject to
dz &minus; pdx &minus; qdy = 0, they must in fact be subject to at least three
mutual relations. If we associate with a point (x, y, z) the plane</p>

<p class="center">Z &minus; z = p(X &minus; x) + q(Y &minus; y)</p>

<p class="noind">passing through it, where X, Y, Z are current co-ordinates, and
call this association a surface-element; and if two consecutive
elements of which the point(x + dx, y + dy, z + dz) of one lies on the
plane of the other, for which, that is, the condition dz = pdx + qdy
is satisfied, be said to be <i>connected,</i> and an infinity of connected
elements following one another continuously be called a <i>connectivity</i>,
then our statement is that a connectivity consists of not
more than &infin;² elements, the whole number of elements (x, y, z, p, q)
that are possible being called &infin;<span class="sp">5</span>. The solution of an equation
F(x, y, z, dz/dx, dz/dy) = 0 is then to be understood to mean finding
in all possible ways, from the &infin;<span class="sp">4</span> elements (x, y, z, p, q) which
satisfy F(x, y, z, p, q) = 0 a set of &infin;² elements forming a connectivity;
or, more analytically, finding in all possible ways two
relations G = 0, H = 0 connecting x, y, z, p, q and independent of
F = 0, so that the three relations together may involve</p>

<p class="center">dz = pdx + qdy.</p>

<p class="noind">Such a set of three relations may, for example, be of the form
z = &psi;(x, y), p = d&psi;/dx, q = d&psi;/dy; but it may also, as another
case, involve two relations z = &psi;(y), x = &psi;<span class="su">1</span>(y) connecting x, y, z,
the third relation being</p>

<p class="center">&psi;&prime;(y) = p&psi;&prime;<span class="su">1</span>(y) + q,</p>

<p class="noind">the connectivity consisting in that case, geometrically, of a curve
in space taken with &infin;¹ of its tangent planes; or, finally, a
connectivity is constituted by a fixed point and all the planes
passing through that point. This generalized view of the meaning
of a solution of F = 0 is of advantage, moreover, in view of
anomalies otherwise arising from special forms of the equation
<span class="sidenote">Meaning of a solution of the equation.</span>
itself. For instance, we may include the case, sometimes
arising when the equation to be solved is obtained
by transformation from another equation, in which F
does not contain either p or q. Then the equation has
&infin;² solutions, each consisting of an arbitrary point of the surface
F = 0 and all the &infin;² planes passing through this point; it also
has &infin;² solutions, each consisting of a curve drawn on the surface
F = 0 and all the tangent planes of this curve, the whole consisting
of &infin;² elements; finally, it has also an isolated (or singular)
solution consisting of the points of the surface, each associated
with the tangent plane of the surface thereat, also &infin;² elements in
all. Or again, a linear equation F = Pp + Qq &minus; R = 0, wherein
P, Q, R are functions of x, y, z only, has &infin;² solutions, each
consisting of one of the curves defined by</p>

<p class="center">dx/P = dy/Q = dz/R</p>

<p class="noind">taken with all the tangent planes of this curve; and the same
equation has &infin;² solutions, each consisting of the points of a
surface containing &infin;¹ of these curves and the tangent planes of
this surface. And for the case of n variables there is similarly
the possibility of n + 1 kinds of solution of an equation
F(x<span class="su">1</span>, ... x<span class="su">n</span>, z, p<span class="su">1</span>, ... p<span class="su">n</span>) = 0; these can, however, by a
simple contact transformation be reduced to one kind, in which
there is only one relation z&prime; = &psi;(x&prime;<span class="su">1</span>, ... x&prime;<span class="su">n</span>) connecting the
new variables x&rsquo;<span class="su">1</span>, ... x&prime;<span class="su">n</span>, z&prime; (see under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Pfaffian Expressions</a></span>);
just as in the case of the solution</p>

<p class="center">z = &psi;(y), x = &psi;<span class="su">1</span>(y), &psi;&prime;(y) = p&psi;&prime;<span class="su">1</span>(y) + q</p>

<p class="noind">of the transformed equation. These explanations take no
account of the possibility of p and q being infinite; this can be
dealt with by writing p = -u/w, q = -v/w, and considering
homogeneous equations in u, v, w, with udx + vdy + wdz = 0 as the
differential relation necessary for a connectivity; in practice we
use the ideas associated with such a procedure more often without
the appropriate notation.</p>

<p>In utilizing these general notions we shall first consider
the theory of characteristic chains, initiated by Cauchy, which
shows well the nature of the relations implied by the given
differential equation; the alternative ways of carrying
<span class="sidenote">Order of the ideas.</span>
out the necessary integrations are suggested by considering
the method of Jacobi and Mayer, while a good
summary is obtained by the formulation in terms of a Pfaffian
expression.</p>

<p>Consider a solution of F = 0 expressed by the three independent
equations F = 0, G = 0, H = 0. If it be a solution in which there is
more than one relation connecting x, y, z, let new variables x&prime;, y&prime;, z&prime;, p&prime;, q&prime;
be introduced, as before explained under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Pfaffian Expressions</a></span>,
<span class="sidenote">Characteristic chains.</span>
in which z&rsquo; is of the form</p>

<p class="center">z&prime; = z &minus; p<span class="su">1</span>x<span class="su">1</span> &minus; ... &minus; p<span class="su">s</span>x<span class="su">s</span> (s = 1 or 2),</p>

<p class="noind">so that the solution becomes of a form z&rsquo; = &psi;(x&prime;y&prime;),
p&prime; = d&psi;/dx&prime;, q&prime; = d&psi;/dy&prime;, which then will identically satisfy the transformed
equations F&prime; = 0, G&prime; = 0, H&prime; = 0. The equation F&prime; = 0, if x&prime;, y&prime;, z&prime;
be regarded as fixed, states that the plane Z &minus; z&prime; = p&prime;(X &minus; x&prime;)  + q&prime;(Y &minus; y&prime;)
is tangent to a certain cone whose vertex is (x&prime;, y&prime;, z&prime;), the consecutive
point (x&prime; + dx&prime;, y&prime; + dy&prime;, z&prime; + dz&prime;) of the generator of contact being such

denominators, are developable, to define, from the differential
equation F&prime; = 0 alone, a connectivity of &infin;¹ elements, which we call
a <i>characteristic chain</i>; and it is remarkable that when we transform
again to the original variables (x, y, z, p, q), the form of the differential
equations for the chain is unaltered, so that they can be written
down at once from the equation F = 0. Thus we have proved that
the characteristic chain starting from any ordinary element of any
integral of this equation F = 0 consists only of elements belonging
to this integral. For instance, if the equation do not contain p, q,
the characteristic chain, starting from an arbitrary plane through
an arbitrary point of the surface F = 0, consists of a pencil of planes
whose axis is a tangent line of the surface F = 0. Or if F = 0 be of
the form Pp + Qq = R, the chain consists of a curve satisfying
dx/P = dy/Q = dz/R and a single infinity of tangent planes of this
curve, determined by the tangent plane chosen at the initial point.

<p class="noind">shows that U is everywhere zero. Thus integrals of F = 0 are
obtainable by considering the aggregate of characteristic chains
issuing from arbitrary chain connectivities T satisfying F = 0; and
such connectivities T are, it is seen at once, determinable without
integration. Conversely, as such a chain connectivity T can be taken
out from the elements of any given integral all possible integrals
are obtainable in this way. For instance, an arbitrary curve in
space, given by x<span class="su">0</span> = &theta;(u), y<span class="su">0</span> = &phi;(u), z<span class="su">0</span> = &psi;(u), determines by the two
equations F(x<span class="su">0</span>, y<span class="su">0</span>, z<span class="su">0</span>, p<span class="su">0</span>, q<span class="su">0</span>) = 0, &psi;&prime;(u) = p<span class="su">0</span>&theta;&prime;(u) + q<span class="su">0</span>&phi;&prime;(u), such a
chain connectivity T, through which there passes a perfectly
definite integral of the equation F = 0. By taking &infin;² initial chain
connectivities T, as for instance by taking the curves x<span class="su">0</span> = &theta;, y<span class="su">0</span>  = &phi;,
z<span class="su">0</span>  = &psi; to be the &infin;² curves upon an arbitrary surface, we thus obtain
&infin;² integrals, and so &infin;<span class="sp">4</span> elements satisfying F = 0. In general, if
functions G, H, independent of F, be obtained, such that the
equations F = 0, G = b, H = c represent an integral for all values of the
constants b, c, these equations are said to constitute a <i>complete
integral</i>. Then &infin;<span class="sp">4</span> elements satisfying F = 0 are known, and in fact
every other form of integral can be obtained without further integrations.</p>

<p>In the foregoing discussion of the differential equations of a
characteristic chain, the denominators dF/dp, ... may be supposed
to be modified in form by means of F = 0 in any way conducive to
a simple integration. In the immediately following explanation of
ideas, however, we consider indifferently all equations F = constant;
when a function of x, y, z, p, q is said to be zero, it is meant that this
is so identically, not in virtue of F = 0; in other words, we consider
the integration of F = a, where a is an arbitrary constant. In the
theory of linear partial equations we have seen that the integration
<span class="sidenote">Operations necessary for integration of F = a.</span>
of the equations of the characteristic chains, from which,
as has just been seen, that of the equation F = a follows
at once, would be involved in completely integrating
the single linear homogeneous partial differential equation
of the first order [F&fnof;] = 0 where the notation is that
explained above under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Contact Transformations</a></span>. One
obvious integral is &fnof; = F. Putting F = a, where a is arbitrary,
and eliminating one of the independent variables, we can reduce
this equation [F&fnof;] = 0 to one in four variables; and so on. Calling, then,
the determination of a single integral of a single homogeneous partial
differential equation of the first order in n independent variables, <i>an
operation of order</i> n &minus; 1, the characteristic chains, and therefore the
most general integral of F = a, can be obtained by successive operations
of orders 3, 2, 1. If, however, an integral of F = a be represented
by F = a, G = b, H = c, where b and c are arbitrary constants,
the expression of the fact that a characteristic chain of F = a satisfies
dG = 0, gives [FG] = 0; similarly, [FH] = 0 and [GH] = 0, these
three relations being identically true. Conversely, suppose that an
integral G, independent of F, has been obtained of the equation
[F&fnof;] = 0, which is an operation of order three. Then it follows from
the identity [&fnof;[&phi;&psi;]] + [&phi;[&psi;&fnof;]] + [&psi;[&fnof;&phi;]] = d&fnof;/dz [&psi;&phi;] + d&phi;/dz [&psi;&fnof;] + d&psi;/dz [&fnof;&phi;] before
remarked, by putting &phi; = F, &psi; = G, and then [F&fnof;] = A(&fnof;), [G&fnof;] = B(&fnof;),
that AB(&fnof;) &minus; BA(&fnof;) = dF/dz B(&fnof;) &minus; dG/dz A(&fnof;), so that the two linear equations
[F&fnof;] = 0, [G&fnof;] = 0 form a complete system; as two integrals F, G are
known, they have a common integral H, independent of F, G, determinable
by an operation of order one only. The three functions
F, G, H thus identically satisfy the relations [FG] = [GH] = [FH] = 0.
The &infin;² elements satisfying F = a, G = b, H = c, wherein a, b, c are
assigned constants, can then be seen to constitute an integral of F = a.
For the conditions that a characteristic chain of G = b issuing from
an element satisfying F = a, G = b, H = c should consist only of
elements satisfying these three equations are simply [FG] = 0, [GH] = 0.
Thus, starting from an arbitrary element of (F = a, G = b, H = c), we
can single out a connectivity of elements of (F = a, G = b, H = c)
forming a characteristic chain of G = b; then the aggregate of the
characteristic chains of F = a issuing from the elements of this
characteristic chain of G = b will be a connectivity consisting only of
elements of</p>

<p class="center">(F = a, G = b, H = c),</p>

<p class="noind">and will therefore constitute an integral of F = a; further, it will
include all elements of (F = a, G = b, H = c). This result follows also
from a theorem given under <i>Contact Transformations</i>, which shows,
moreover, that though the characteristic chains of F = a are not
determined by the three equations F = a, G = b, H = c, no further
integration is now necessary to find them. By this theorem, since
identically [FG] = [GH] = [FH] = 0, we can find, by the solution of
linear algebraic equations only, a non-vanishing function &sigma; and two
functions A, C, such that</p>

<p class="center">dG &minus; AdF &minus; CdH = &sigma;(dz &minus; pdz &minus; qdy);</p>

<p class="noind">thus all the elements satisfying F = a, G = b, H = c, satisfy dz = pdx + qdy
and constitute a connectivity, which is therefore an integral of
F = a. While, further, from the associated theorems, F, G, H, A, C
are independent functions and [FC] = 0. Thus C may be taken to
be the remaining integral independent of G, H, of the equation
[F&fnof;] = 0, whereby the characteristic chains are entirely determined.</p>

<p>When we consider the particular equation F = 0, neglecting the
case when neither p nor q enters, and supposing p to enter, we may
express p from F = 0 in terms of x, y, z, q, and then eliminate it from
all other equations. Then instead of the equation [F&fnof;] = 0, we
have, if F = 0 give p = &psi;(x, y, z, q), the equation</p>

already given, the common integral, if existent, must be satisfied
by the equations of the characteristic chains of any one equation

of the equations expressing the integral, and we may without loss of

formed from the r given differential equations vanishes in virtue of
these equations. The determination of the remaining n + 1 &minus; r

method and reduce the simultaneous linear equations to one equation
involving parameters; while if at any stage of the process we find
some but not all of the integrals of the simultaneous system, they

<p>A system of differential equations is said to allow a certain
continuous group of transformations (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Groups, Theory of</a></span>)
when the introduction for the variables in the differential
equations of the new variables given by the
<span class="sidenote">Application of theory of continuous groups to formal theories.</span>
equations of the group leads, for all values of the
parameters of the group, to the same differential equations
in the new variables. It would be interesting
to verify in examples that this is the case in at least
the majority of the differential equations which are
known to be integrable in finite terms. We give a theorem of
very general application for the case of a simultaneous complete
system of linear partial homogeneous differential equations of the
first order, to the solution of which the various differential equations
discussed have been reduced. It will be enough to consider
whether the given differential equations allow the infinitesimal
transformations of the group.</p>

<p>It can be shown easily that sufficient conditions in order that a
complete system &Pi;<span class="su">1</span>&fnof; = 0 ... &Pi;<span class="su">k</span>&fnof; = 0, in n independent variables,
should allow the infinitesimal transformation P&fnof; = 0 are expressed
by k equations &Pi;<span class="su">i</span>P&fnof; &minus; P&Pi;<span class="su">i</span>&fnof; = &lambda;<span class="su">i1</span>&Pi;<span class="su">1</span>&fnof; + ... + &lambda;<span class="su">ik</span>&Pi;<span class="su">k</span>&fnof;. Suppose now
a complete system of n &minus; r equations in n variables to allow a
group of r infinitesimal transformations (P<span class="su">1</span>f, ..., P<span class="su">r</span>&fnof;) which has
an invariant subgroup of r &minus; 1 parameters (P<span class="su">1</span>&fnof;, ..., P<span class="su">r-1</span>&fnof;), it
being supposed that the n quantities &Pi;<span class="su">1</span>&fnof;, ..., &Pi;<span class="su">n-r</span>&fnof;, P<span class="su">1</span>&fnof;, ...,
P<span class="su">r</span>&fnof; are not connected by an identical linear equation (with coefficients
even depending on the independent variables). Then
it can be shown that one solution of the complete system is determinable
by a quadrature. For each of &Pi;<span class="su">i</span>P&sigma;&fnof; &minus; P&sigma;&Pi;<span class="su">i</span>f is a linear
function of &Pi;<span class="su">1</span>&fnof;, ..., &Pi;<span class="su">n-r</span>&fnof; and the simultaneous system of independent
equations &Pi;<span class="su">1</span>&fnof; = 0, ... &Pi;<span class="su">n-r</span>&fnof; = 0, P<span class="su">1</span>&fnof; = 0, ... P<span class="su">r-1</span>&fnof; = 0
is therefore a complete system, allowing the infinitesimal transformation
P<span class="su">r</span>&fnof;. This complete system of n &minus; 1 equations has therefore
one common solution &omega;, and P<span class="su">r</span>(&omega;) is a function of &omega;. By
choosing &omega; suitably, we can then make P<span class="su">r</span>(&omega;) = 1. From this
equation and the n &minus; 1 equations &Pi;<span class="su">i</span>&omega; = 0, P<span class="su">&sigma;&omega;</span> = 0, we can determine
&omega; by a quadrature only. Hence can be deduced a much more
general result, <i>that if the group of r parameters be integrable, the
complete system can be entirety solved by quadratures</i>; it is only
necessary to introduce the solution found by the first quadrature as
an independent variable, whereby we obtain a complete system of
n &minus; r equations in n &minus; 1 variables, subject to an integrable group of
r &minus; 1 parameters, and to continue this process. We give some
examples of the application of the theorem. (1) If an equation of
the first order y&prime; = &psi;(x, y) allow the infinitesimal transformation
&xi;d&fnof;/dx + &eta;d&fnof;/dy, the integral curves &omega;(x, y) = y<span class="sp">0</span>, wherein &omega;(x, y) is
the solution of d&fnof;/dx + &psi;(x, y) d&fnof;/dy = 0 reducing to y for x = x<span class="sp">0</span>, are
interchanged among themselves by the infinitesimal transformation,
or &omega;(x, y) can be chosen to make &xi;d<span class="su">&omega;</span>/dx + &eta;d<span class="su">&omega;</span>/dy = 1; this, with
d&omega;/dx + &psi;d&omega;/dy = 0, determines &omega; as the integral of the complete
differential (dy &minus; &psi;dx)/(&eta; &minus; &psi;&xi;). This result itself shows that every
ordinary differential equation of the first order is subject to an
infinite number of infinitesimal transformations. But every infinitesimal
transformation &xi;d&fnof;/dx + &eta;d&fnof;/dy can by change of variables
(after integration) be brought to the form d&fnof;/dy, and all differential
equations of the first order allowing this group can then be reduced
to the form F(x, dy/dx) = 0. (2) In an ordinary equation of the
second order y&rdquo; = &psi;(x, y, y&prime;), equivalent to dy/dx = y<span class="su">1</span>, dy<span class="su">1</span>/dx = &psi;(x, y, y<span class="su">1</span>),
if H, H<span class="su">1</span> be the solutions for y and y<span class="su">1</span> chosen to reduce to y<span class="sp">0</span> and
yº<span class="su">1</span> when x = x<span class="sp">0</span>, and the equations H = y, H<span class="su">1</span>= y<span class="su">1</span> be equivalent
to &omega; = y<span class="sp">0</span>, &omega;<span class="su">1</span> = yº<span class="su">1</span>, then &omega;, &omega;<span class="su">1</span> are the principal solutions of
&Pi;&fnof; = d&fnof;/dx + y<span class="su">1</span>d&fnof;/dy + &psi;d&fnof;/dy<span class="su">1</span> = 0. If the original equation allow
an infinitesimal transformation whose first <i>extended</i> form (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Groups</a></span>) is P&fnof; = &xi;d&fnof;/dx + &eta;d&fnof;/dy  + &eta;<span class="su">1</span>d&fnof;/dy<span class="su">1</span>, where &eta;<span class="su">1</span>&delta;t is the increment
of dy/dx when &xi;&delta;t, &eta;&delta;t are the increments of x, y, and is to be
expressed in terms of x, y, y<span class="su">1</span>, then each of P&omega; and P&omega;<span class="su">1</span> must
be functions of &omega; and &omega;<span class="su">1</span>, or the partial differential equation &Pi;&fnof;
must allow the group P&fnof;. Thus by our general theorem, if the
differential equation allow a group of two parameters (and such
a group is always integrable), it can be solved by quadratures, our
explanation sufficing, however, only provided the form &Pi;&fnof; and the
two infinitesimal transformations are not linearly connected. It
can be shown, from the fact that &eta;<span class="su">1</span> is a quadratic polynomial in y<span class="su">1</span>,
that no differential equation of the second order can allow more
than 8 really independent infinitesimal transformations, and that
every homogeneous linear differential equation of the second order
allows just 8, being in fact reducible to d²y/dx² = 0. Since every
group of more than two parameters has subgroups of two parameters,
a differential equation of the second order allowing a group
of more than two parameters can, as a rule, be solved by quadratures.
By transforming the group we see that if a differential equation of
the second order allows a single infinitesimal transformation, it can
be transformed to the form F(x, d&gamma;/dx, d²&gamma;/dx²); this is not the case
for every differential equation of the second order. (3) For an
ordinary differential equation of the third order, allowing an integrable
group of three parameters whose infinitesimal transformations
are not linearly connected with the partial equation to which the
solution of the given ordinary equation is reducible, the similar
result follows that it can be integrated by quadratures. But if the
group of three parameters be simple, this result must be replaced
by the statement that the integration is reducible to quadratures
and that of a so-called Riccati equation of the first order, of the
form dy/dx = A + By + Cy², where A, B, C are functions of x. (4) Similarly
for the integration by quadratures of an ordinary equation
y<span class="su">n</span> = &psi;(x, y, y<span class="su">1</span>, ... y<span class="su">n-1</span>) of any order. Moreover, the group allowed
by the equation may quite well consist of extended contact transformations.
An important application is to the case where the differential
equation is the resolvent equation defining the group of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>235</span>
transformations or rationality group of another differential equation
(see below); in particular, when the rationality group of an ordinary
linear differential equation is integrable, the equation can be solved
by quadratures.</p>

<p>Following the practical and provisional division of theories
of differential equations, to which we alluded at starting, into
transformation theories and function theories, we pass
now to give some account of the latter. These are both
<span class="sidenote">Consideration of function theories of differential equations.</span>
a necessary logical complement of the former, and the
only remaining resource when the expedients of the
former have been exhausted. While in the former
investigations we have dealt only with values of the
independent variables about which the functions are
developable, the leading idea now becomes, as was long ago
remarked by G. Green, the consideration of the neighbourhood of
the values of the variables for which this developable character
ceases. Beginning, as before, with existence theorems applicable
for ordinary values of the variables, we are to consider the cases of
failure of such theorems.</p>

<p>When in a given set of differential equations the number of
equations is greater than the number of dependent variables, the
equations cannot be expected to have common solutions unless
certain conditions of compatibility, obtainable by equating
different forms of the same differential coefficients deducible from
the equations, are satisfied. We have had examples in systems
of linear equations, and in the case of a set of equations
p<span class="su">1</span> = &phi;<span class="su">1</span>, ..., p<span class="su">r</span> = &phi;<span class="su">r</span>. For the case when the number of equations
is the same as that of dependent variables, the following is a
general theorem which should be referred to: Let there be r
equations in r dependent variables z<span class="su">1</span>, ... z<span class="su">r</span> and n independent

<p class="noind">reduces to b<span class="sp">&rho;</span><span class="su">k1 ... kn</span>. Then the theorem is that there exists

ordinary power series in x<span class="su">1</span> &minus; a<span class="su">1</span>, ... x<span class="su">n</span> &minus; a<span class="su">n</span>, t<span class="su">1</span> &minus; tº<span class="su">1</span>, ... t<span class="su">m</span> &minus; tº<span class="su">m</span>
be substituted in the equations wherein in z<span class="su">&sigma;</span> the coefficients of
(x<span class="su">1</span> &minus; a<span class="su">1</span>)º, x<span class="su">1</span> &minus; a<span class="su">1</span>, ..., (x<span class="su">1</span> &minus; a<span class="su">1</span>)<span class="sp">h&sigma;&minus;1</span> are the arbitrary functions
&phi;<span class="su">&sigma;</span>, &phi;<span class="su">&sigma;</span><span class="sp">(1)</span>, ..., &phi;<span class="su">&sigma;</span><span class="sp">h&minus;1</span>, divided respectively by 1, 1!, 2!, &amp;c., then the
differential equations determine uniquely all the other coefficients,
and that the resulting series are convergent. We rely, in fact,
upon the theory of monogenic analytical functions (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Function</a></span>),
a function being determined entirely by its development in the
neighbourhood of one set of values of the independent variables,
from which all its other values arise by <i>continuation</i>; it being of
course understood that the coefficients in the differential equations
are to be continued at the same time. But it is to be remarked that
there is no ground for believing, if this method of continuation be
utilized, that the function is single-valued; we may quite well return
to the same values of the independent variables with a different
<span class="sidenote">Singular points of solutions.</span>
value of the function; belonging, as we say, to a different
branch of the function; and there is even no reason for
assuming that the number of branches is finite, or that
different branches have the same singular points and
regions of existence. Moreover, and this is the most difficult consideration
of all, all these circumstances may be dependent upon the
values supposed given to the arbitrary constants of the integral; in
other words, the singular points may be either <i>fixed</i>, being determined
by the differential equations themselves, or they may be
<i>movable</i> with the variation of the arbitrary constants of integration.
Such difficulties arise even in establishing the reversion of an elliptic
integral, in solving the equation</p>

<p class="center">(dx/ds)² = (x &minus; a<span class="su">1</span>)(x &minus; a<span class="su">2</span>)(x &minus; a<span class="su">3</span>)(x &minus; a<span class="su">4</span>);</p>

<p class="noind">about an ordinary value the right side is developable; if we put
x &minus; a<span class="su">1</span> = t<span class="su">1</span>², the right side becomes developable about t<span class="su">1</span> = 0; if we
put x = 1/t, the right side of the changed equation is developable
about t = 0; it is quite easy to show that the integral reducing to a
definite value x<span class="su">0</span> for a value s<span class="su">0</span> is obtainable by a series in integral
powers; this, however, must be supplemented by showing that for
no value of s does the value of x become entirely undetermined.</p>

<p>These remarks will show the place of the theory now to be
sketched of a particular class of ordinary linear homogeneous
<span class="sidenote">Linear differential equations with rational coefficients.</span>
differential equations whose importance arises from
the completeness and generality with which they can
be discussed. We have seen that if in the equations</p>

<p class="center">dy/dx = y<span class="su">1</span>, dy<span class="su">1</span>/dx = y<span class="su">2</span>, ..., dy<span class="su">n&minus;2</span>/dx = y<span class="su">n&minus;1</span>,<br />

<p class="noind">where a<span class="su">1</span>, a<span class="su">2</span>, ..., a<span class="su">n</span> are now to be taken to be rational
functions of x, the value x  = xº be one for which no one of
these rational functions is infinite, and yº, yº<span class="su">1</span>, ..., yº<span class="su">n&minus;1</span> be quite
arbitrary finite values, then the equations are satisfied by</p>

<p class="center">y = yºu + yº<span class="su">1</span>u<span class="su">1</span> + ... + yº<span class="su">n&minus;1</span>u<span class="su">n&minus;1</span>,</p>

<p class="noind">where u, u<span class="su">1</span>, ..., u<span class="su">n&minus;1</span> are functions of x, independent of yº, ...

x = xº the functions y, y<span class="su">1</span> ... y<span class="su">n&minus;1</span> reduce respectively to yº, yº<span class="su">1</span>,
... yº<span class="su">n&minus;1</span>; it can be proved that the region of existence of these
series extends within a circle centre xº and radius equal to the
distance from xº of the nearest point at which one of a<span class="su">1</span>, ... a<span class="su">n</span>
becomes infinite. Now consider a region enclosing xº and only one
of the places, say &Sigma;, at which one of a<span class="su">1</span>, ... a<span class="su">n</span> becomes infinite.
When x is made to describe a closed curve in this region, including
this point &Sigma; in its interior, it may well happen that the continuations
of the functions u, u<span class="su">1</span>, ..., u<span class="su">n&minus;1</span> give, when we have returned to
the point x, values v, v<span class="su">1</span>, ..., v<span class="su">n&minus;1</span>, so that the integral under consideration
becomes changed to yº + yº<span class="su">1</span>v<span class="su">1</span> + ... + yº<span class="su">n&minus;1</span>v<span class="su">n&minus;1</span>. At
xº let this branch and the corresponding values of y<span class="su">1</span>, ... y<span class="su">n&minus;1</span> be
&eta;º, &eta;º<span class="su">1</span>, ... &eta;º<span class="su">n&minus;1</span>; then, as there is only one series satisfying the
equation and reducing to (&eta;º, &eta;º<span class="su">1</span>, ... &eta;º<span class="su">n&minus;1</span>) for x = xº and the
coefficients in the differential equation are single-valued functions,
we must have &eta;ºu + &eta;º<span class="su">1</span>u<span class="su">1</span> + ... + &eta;º<span class="su">n&minus;1</span>u<span class="su">n&minus;1</span> = yºv + yº<span class="su">1</span>v<span class="su">1</span> + ...
+ yº<span class="su">n&minus;1</span>v<span class="su">n&minus;1</span>; as this holds for arbitrary values of yº ... yº<span class="su">n&minus;1</span>, upon
which u, ... u<span class="su">n&minus;1</span> and v, ... v<span class="su">n&minus;1</span> do not depend, it follows that
each of v, ... v<span class="su">n&minus;1</span> is a linear function of u, ... u<span class="su">n&minus;1</span> with constant
coefficients, say v<span class="su">i</span> = A<span class="su">i1</span>u + ... + A<span class="su">in</span>u<span class="su">n&minus;1</span>. Then</p>

<p class="center">yºv + ... + yº<span class="su">n&minus;1</span>v<span class="su">n&minus;1</span> = (&Sigma;<span class="su">i</span> A<span class="su">i1</span> yº<span class="su">i</span>)u + ... + (&Sigma;<span class="su">i</span> A<span class="su">in</span> yº<span class="su">i</span>) u<span class="su">n&minus;1</span>;</p>

<p class="noind">this is equal to &mu;(yºu + ... + yº<span class="su">n&minus;1</span>u<span class="su">n&minus;1</span>) if &Sigma;<span class="su">i</span> A<span class="su">ir</span> yº<span class="su">i</span> = &mu;yº<span class="su">r&minus;1</span>;
eliminating yº ... yº<span class="su">n&minus;1</span> from these linear equations, we have a
determinantal equation of order n for &mu;; let &mu;<span class="su">1</span> be one of its roots;
determining the ratios of yº, y<span class="su">1</span>º, ... yº<span class="su">n&minus;1</span> to satisfy the linear
equations, we have thus proved that there exists an integral,
H, of the equation, which when continued round the point &Sigma; and
back to the starting-point, becomes changed to H<span class="su">1</span> = &mu;<span class="su">1</span>H. Let now
&xi; be the value of x at &Sigma; and r<span class="su">1</span> one of the values of (½&pi;i) log &mu;<span class="su">1</span>;
consider the function (x &minus; &xi;)<span class="sp">&minus;r1</span>H; when x makes a circuit round x = &xi;,
this becomes changed to</p>

<p class="center">exp (-2&pi;ir<span class="su">1</span>) (x &minus; &xi;)<span class="sp">&minus;r1</span> &mu;H,</p>

<p class="noind">that is, is unchanged; thus we may put H = (x &minus; &xi;)<span class="sp">r1</span>&phi;<span class="su">1</span>, &phi;<span class="su">1</span> being a
function single-valued for paths in the region considered described
about &Sigma;, and therefore, by Laurent&rsquo;s Theorem (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Function</a></span>),
capable of expression in the annular region about this point by a
series of positive and negative integral powers of x &minus; &xi;, which in
general may contain an infinite number of negative powers; there is,
however, no reason to suppose r<span class="su">1</span> to be an integer, or even real.
Thus, if all the roots of the determinantal equation in &mu; are different,
we obtain n integrals of the forms (x &minus; &xi;)<span class="sp">r1</span>&phi;<span class="su">1</span>, ..., (x &minus; &xi;)<span class="sp">rn</span>&phi;<span class="su">n</span>.
In general we obtain as many integrals of this form as there are
really different roots; and the problem arises to discover, in case a
root be k times repeated, k &minus; 1 equations of as simple a form as
possible to replace the k &minus; 1 equations of the form yº + ... +
yº<span class="su">n&minus;1</span>v<span class="su">n&minus;1</span> = &mu;(yº + ... + yº<span class="su">n&minus;1</span>u<span class="su">n&minus;1</span>) which would have existed had
the roots been different. The most natural method of obtaining
a suggestion lies probably in remarking that if r<span class="su">2</span> = r<span class="su">1</span> + h, there is an
integral [(x &minus; &xi;)<span class="sp">r1 + h</span>&phi;<span class="su">2</span> &minus; (x &minus; &xi;)<span class="sp">r1</span>&phi;<span class="su">1</span>] / h, where the coefficients in &phi;<span class="su">2</span> are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>236</span>
the same functions of r<span class="su">1</span> + h as are the coefficients in &phi;<span class="su">1</span> of r<span class="su">1</span>; when
h vanishes, this integral takes the form</p>

<p class="center">(x &minus; &xi;)<span class="sp">r1</span> [d&phi;<span class="su">1</span>/dr<span class="su">1</span> + &phi;<span class="su">1</span> log (x &minus; &xi;)],</p>

<p class="noind">or say</p>

<p class="center">(x &minus; &xi;)<span class="sp">r1</span> [&phi;<span class="su">1</span> + &psi;<span class="su">1</span> log (x &minus; &xi;)];</p>

<p class="noind">A similar artifice suggests itself when three of the roots of the determinantal
equation are the same, and so on. We are thus led to the
result, which is justified by an examination of the algebraic conditions,
that whatever may be the circumstances as to the roots of the
determinantal equation, n integrals exist, breaking up into
batches, the values of the constituents H<span class="su">1</span>, H<span class="su">2</span>, ... of a batch after
circuit about x = &xi; being H<span class="su">1</span>&prime; = &mu;<span class="su">1</span>H<span class="su">1</span>, H<span class="su">2</span>&prime; = &mu;<span class="su">1</span>H<span class="su">2</span> + H<span class="su">1</span>, H<span class="su">3</span>&prime; = &mu;<span class="su">1</span>H<span class="su">3</span> + H<span class="su">2</span>,
and so on. And this is found to lead to the forms (x &minus; &xi;)<span class="sp">r1</span>&phi;<span class="su">1</span>,
(x &minus; &xi;)<span class="sp">r1</span> [&psi;<span class="su">1</span> + &phi;<span class="su">1</span> log (x &minus; &xi;)],
(x &minus; &xi;)<span class="sp">r1</span> [&chi;<span class="su">1</span> + &chi;<span class="su">2</span> log (x &minus; &xi;) + &phi;<span class="su">1</span>(log(x &minus; &xi;) )²],
and so on. Here each of &phi;<span class="su">1</span>, &psi;<span class="su">1</span>, &chi;<span class="su">1</span>, &chi;<span class="su">2</span>, ... is a series of positive
and negative integral powers of x &minus; &xi; in which the number of negative
powers may be infinite.</p>

<p>It appears natural enough now to inquire whether, under proper
conditions for the forms of the rational functions a<span class="su">1</span>, ... a<span class="su">n</span>, it may
be possible to ensure that in each of the series &phi;<span class="su">1</span>, &psi;<span class="su">1</span>, [chi]<span class="su">1</span>, ...
the number of negative powers shall be finite. Herein
<span class="sidenote">Regular equations.</span>
lies, in fact, the limitation which experience has shown
to be justified by the completeness of the results obtained. Assuming
n integrals in which in each of &phi;<span class="su">1</span>, &psi;<span class="su">1</span>, &chi;<span class="su">1</span> ... the number of
negative powers is finite, there is a definite homogeneous linear
differential equation having these integrals; this is found by
forming it to have the form</p>

<p class="center">y&prime; <span class="sp">n</span> = (x &minus; &xi;)<span class="sp">&minus;1</span> b<span class="su">1</span>y&prime; <span class="sp">(n&minus;1)</span> + (x &minus; &xi;)<span class="sp">&minus;2</span> b<span class="su">2</span>y&prime; <span class="sp">(n&minus;2)</span> + ... + (x &minus; &xi;)<span class="sp">&minus;n</span> b<span class="su">n</span>y,</p>

<p class="noind">where b<span class="su">1</span>, ... b<span class="su">n</span> are finite for x = &xi;. Conversely, assume the
equation to have this form. Then on substituting a series of
the form (x &minus; &xi;)<span class="sp">r</span> [1 + A<span class="su">1</span>(x &minus; &xi;) + A<span class="su">2</span>(x &minus; &xi;)² +  ... ] and equating the
coefficients of like powers of x &minus; &xi;, it is found that r must be a root of
an algebraic equation of order n; this equation, which we shall call
the index equation, can be obtained at once by substituting for y
only (x &minus; &xi;)<span class="sp">r</span> and replacing each of b<span class="su">1</span>, ... b<span class="su">n</span> by their values at
x = &xi;; arrange the roots r<span class="su">1</span>, r<span class="su">2</span>, ... of this equation so that the
real part of r<span class="su">i</span> is equal to, or greater than, the real part of r<span class="su">i+1</span>,
and take r equal to r<span class="su">1</span>; it is found that the coefficients A<span class="su">1</span>, A<span class="su">2</span> ...
are uniquely determinate, and that the series converges within a
circle about x = &xi; which includes no other of the points at which
the rational functions a<span class="su">1</span> ... a<span class="su">n</span> become infinite. We have thus a
solution H<span class="su">1</span> = (x &minus; &xi;)<span class="sp">r1</span>&phi;<span class="su">1</span> of the differential equation. If we now
substitute in the equation y = H<span class="su">1</span>&int;&eta;dx, it is found to reduce to an
equation of order n &minus; 1 for &eta; of the form</p>

<p class="center">&eta;&prime; <span class="sp">(n&minus;1)</span> = (x &minus; &xi;)<span class="sp">&minus;1</span> c<span class="su">1</span>&eta;&prime; <span class="sp">(n&minus;2)</span> + ... + (x &minus; &xi;)<span class="sp">(n&minus;1)</span> c<span class="su">n&minus;1</span>&eta;,</p>

<p class="noind">where c<span class="su">1</span>, ... c<span class="su">n&minus;1</span> are not infinite at x = &xi;. To this equation
precisely similar reasoning can then be applied; its index equation
has in fact the roots r<span class="su">2</span> &minus; r<span class="su">1</span> &minus; 1, ..., r<span class="su">n</span> &minus; r<span class="su">1</span> &minus; 1; if r<span class="su">2</span> &minus; r<span class="su">1</span> be zero,
the integral (x &minus; &xi;)<span class="sp">&minus;1</span>&psi;<span class="su">1</span> of the &eta; equation will give an integral of the
original equation containing log (x &minus; &xi;); if r<span class="su">2</span> &minus; r<span class="su">1</span> be an integer, and
therefore a negative integer, the same will be true, unless in &psi;<span class="su">1</span> the
term in (x &minus; &xi;)<span class="sp">r1 &minus; r2</span> be absent; if neither of these arise, the original
equation will have an integral (x &minus; &xi;)<span class="sp">r2</span>&phi;<span class="su">2</span>. The &eta; equation can now,
by means of the one integral of it belonging to the index r<span class="su">2</span> &minus; r<span class="su">1</span> &minus; 1,
be similarly reduced to one of order n &minus; 2, and so on. The result will
be that stated above. We shall say that an equation of the form in
question is <i>regular</i> about x = &xi;.</p>

<p>We may examine in this way the behaviour of the integrals at
all the points at which any one of the rational functions a<span class="su">1</span> ... a<span class="su">n</span>
becomes infinite; in general we must expect that beside
these the value x = &infin; will be a singular point for the
<span class="sidenote">Fuchsian equations.</span>
solutions of the differential equation. To test this we
put x = 1/t throughout, and examine as before at t = 0. For instance,
the ordinary linear equation with constant coefficients has no singular
point for finite values of x; at x = &infin; it has a singular point and is not
regular; or again, Bessel&rsquo;s equation x²y&Prime; + xy&prime; + (x² &minus; n²)y = 0 is
regular about x = 0, but not about x = &infin;. An equation regular at all
the finite singularities and also at x = &infin; is called a Fuchsian equation.
We proceed to examine particularly the case of an equation of the
second order</p>

<p class="center">y&Prime; + ay&prime; + by = 0.</p>

<p class="noind">Putting x = 1/t, it becomes</p>

<p class="center">d²y/dt² + (2t<span class="sp">&minus;1</span> &minus; at<span class="sp">&minus;2</span>) dy/dt + bt<span class="sp">&minus;4</span> y = 0,</p>

<p class="noind">which is not regular about t = 0 unless 2 &minus; at<span class="sp">&minus;1</span> and bt<span class="sp">&minus;2</span>, that is,
unless ax and bx² are finite at x = &infin;; which we thus assume; putting
y = t<span class="sp">r</span>(1 + A<span class="su">1</span>t +  ... ), we find for the index equation at x = &infin;
the equation r(r &minus; 1) + r(2 &minus; ax)<span class="su">0</span> + (bx²)<span class="su">0</span> = 0. If there be
<span class="sidenote">Equation of the second order.</span>
finite singular points at &xi;<span class="su">1</span>, ... &xi;<span class="su">m</span>, where we assume
m &gt; 1, the cases m = 0, m = 1 being easily dealt with, and
if &phi;(x) = (x &minus; &xi;<span class="su">1</span>) ... (x &minus; &xi;<span class="su">m</span>), we must have a·&phi;(x)
and b·[&phi;(x)]² finite for all finite values of x, equal say to the respective
polynomials &psi;(x) and &theta;(x), of which by the conditions at
x = &infin; the highest respective orders possible are m &minus; 1 and 2(m &minus; 1).
The index equation at x = &xi;<span class="su">1</span> is r(r &minus; 1) + r&psi;(&xi;<span class="su">1</span>) / &phi;&prime; (&xi;<span class="su">1</span>) + &theta;(&xi;)<span class="su">1</span> / [&phi;&prime;(&xi;<span class="su">1</span>)]² = 0,
and if &alpha;<span class="su">1</span>, &beta;<span class="su">1</span> be its roots, we have &alpha;<span class="su">1</span> + &beta;<span class="su">1</span> = 1 &minus; &psi;(&xi;<span class="su">1</span>) / &phi;&prime; (&xi;<span class="su">1</span>) and
&alpha;<span class="su">1</span>&beta;<span class="su">1</span> = &theta;(&xi;)<span class="su">1</span> / [&phi;&prime;(&xi;<span class="su">1</span>)]². Thus by an elementary theorem of algebra,
the sum &Sigma;(1 &minus; &alpha;<span class="su">i</span> &minus; &beta;<span class="su">i</span>) / (x &minus; &xi;<span class="su">i</span>), extended to the m finite singular
points, is equal to &psi;(x) / &phi;(x), and the sum &Sigma;(1 &minus; &alpha;<span class="su">i</span> &minus; &beta;<span class="su">i</span>) is equal to
the ratio of the coefficients of the highest powers of x in &psi;(x) and
&phi;(x), and therefore equal to 1 + &alpha; + &beta;, where &alpha;, &beta; are the indices at
x = &infin;. Further, if (x, 1)<span class="su">m&minus;2</span> denote the integral part of the quotient
&theta;(x) / &phi;(x), we have &Sigma; &alpha;<span class="su">i</span>&beta;<span class="su">i</span>&phi;&prime; (&xi;<span class="su">i</span>) / (x = &xi;<span class="su">i</span>) equal to &minus;(x, 1)<span class="su">m&minus;2</span> + &theta;(x)/&phi;(x),
and the coefficient of x<span class="sp">m&minus;2</span> in (x, 1)<span class="su">m&minus;2</span> is &alpha;&beta;. Thus the differential
equation has the form</p>

<p class="center">y&Prime; + y&prime;&Sigma; (1 &minus; &alpha;<span class="su">i</span> &minus; &beta;<span class="su">i</span>) / (x &minus; &xi;<span class="su">i</span>) + y[(x, 1)<span class="su">m-2</span> + &Sigma; &alpha;<span class="su">i</span>&beta;<span class="su">i</span>&phi;&prime;(&xi;<span class="su">i</span>) / (x &minus; &xi;<span class="su">i</span>)]/&phi;(x) = 0.</p>

<p class="noind">If, however, we make a change in the dependent variable, putting
y = (x &minus; &xi;<span class="su">1</span>)<span class="sp">&alpha;1</span> ... (x &minus; &xi;<span class="su">m</span>)<span class="sp">&alpha; m&eta;</span>, it is easy to see that the equation
changes into one having the same singular points about each of
which it is regular, and that the indices at x = &xi;<span class="su">i</span> become 0 and &beta;<span class="su">i</span> &minus; &alpha;<span class="su">i</span>,
which we shall denote by &lambda;<span class="su">i</span>, for (x &minus; &xi;<span class="su">i</span>)<span class="sp">&alpha;j</span> can be developed in positive
integral powers of x &minus; &xi;<span class="su">i</span> about x = &xi;<span class="su">i</span>; by this transformation the

<p class="noind">which we shall denote by &lambda;, &mu;. If we suppose this change to have

the equation has the form</p>

<p class="center">y&Prime; + y&prime;&Sigma; (1 &minus; &lambda;<span class="su">i</span>) / (x &minus; &xi;<span class="su">i</span>) + y(x, 1)<span class="su">m&minus;2</span> / &phi;(x) = 0,</p>

<p class="noind">while &lambda; + &mu; + &lambda;<span class="su">1</span> +  ...  + &lambda;<span class="su">m</span> = m &minus; 1. Conversely, it is easy to verify

the specified singular points and indices whatever be the other

<p>Thus we see that (beside the cases m = 0, m = 1) the &ldquo;Fuchsian

distinguished by the fact that it has a definite form

<p>In accordance with our general theory, logarithms are to be expected
in the solution when one of &lambda;<span class="su">1</span>, &lambda;<span class="su">2</span>, &lambda; &minus; &mu; is zero or integral.
Indeed when &lambda;<span class="su">1</span> is a negative integer, not zero, the second solution
about x = 0 would contain vanishing factors in the denominators
of its coefficients; in case &lambda; or &mu; be one of the positive integers
1, 2, ... (&minus;&lambda;<span class="su">1</span>), vanishing factors occur also in the numerators;
and then, in fact, the second solution about x = 0 becomes x<span class="sp">&lambda;1</span> times
an integral polynomial of degree (&minus;&lambda;<span class="su">1</span>) &minus; &lambda; or of degree (&minus;&lambda;<span class="su">1</span>) &minus; &mu;.
But when &lambda;<span class="su">1</span> is a negative integer including zero, and neither &lambda; nor &mu;
is one of the positive integers 1, 2 ... (&minus;&lambda;<span class="su">1</span>), the second solution
about x = 0 involves a term having the factor log x. When &lambda;<span class="su">1</span> is a
positive integer, not zero, the second solution about x = 0 persists as
a solution, in accordance with the order of arrangement of the roots
of the index equation in our theory; the first solution is then
replaced by an integral polynomial of degree -&lambda; or &minus;&mu;<span class="su">1</span>, when &lambda; or &mu;
is one of the negative integers 0, &minus;1, &minus;2, ..., 1 &minus; &lambda;<span class="su">1</span>, but otherwise
contains a logarithm. Similarly for the solutions about x = 1 or
x = &infin;; it will be seen below how the results are deducible from
those for x = 0.</p>

<p>Denote now the solutions about x = 0 by u<span class="su">1</span>, u<span class="su">2</span>; those about x = 1
by v<span class="su">1</span>, v<span class="su">2</span>; and those about x = &infin; by w<span class="su">1</span>, w<span class="su">2</span>; in the region (S<span class="su">0</span>S<span class="su">1</span>)

are the points x = 0, x = 1, all the first four are valid,

and there exist equations u<span class="su">1</span> =Av<span class="su">1</span> + Bv<span class="su">2</span>, u<span class="su">2</span> = Cv<span class="su">1</span> + Dv<span class="su">2</span>
where A, B, C, D are constants; in the region (S<span class="su">1</span>S)
lying inside the circle S<span class="su">1</span> and outside the circle S<span class="su">0</span>, those that are
valid are v<span class="su">1</span>, v<span class="su">2</span>, w<span class="su">1</span>, w<span class="su">2</span>, and there exist equations v<span class="su">1</span> = Pw<span class="su">1</span> + Qw<span class="su">2</span>,
v<span class="su">2</span> = Rw<span class="su">1</span> + Tw<span class="su">2</span>, where P, Q, R, T are constants; thus considering
any integral whose expression within the circle S<span class="su">0</span> is au<span class="su">1</span> + bu<span class="su">2</span>, where
a, b are constants, the same integral will be represented within the
circle S<span class="su">1</span> by (aA + bC)v<span class="su">1</span> + (aB + bD)v<span class="su">2</span>, and outside these circles will be

<p class="noind">A single-valued branch of such integral can be obtained by making
a barrier in the plane joining &infin; to 0 and 1 to &infin;; for instance, by

<span class="sidenote">Transformation of the equation into itself.</span>
transformed into the hypergeometric equation in 24 ways;
for out of &xi;<span class="su">1</span>, &xi;<span class="su">2</span>, &xi;<span class="su">3</span> we can in six ways choose two, say
&xi;<span class="su">1</span>, &xi;<span class="su">2</span>, which are to be transformed respectively into
0 and 1, by (x &minus; &xi;<span class="su">1</span>)/(x &minus; &xi;<span class="su">2</span>) = t(t &minus; 1); and then there
are four possible transformations of the dependent variable which
will reduce one of the indices at t = 0 to zero and one of the indices
at t = 1 also to zero, namely, we may reduce either &alpha;<span class="su">1</span> or &beta;<span class="su">1</span> at t = 0,
and simultaneously either &alpha;<span class="su">2</span> or &beta;<span class="su">2</span> at t = 1. Thus the hypergeometric
equation itself can be transformed into itself in 24 ways,
and from the expression F(&lambda;, &mu;, 1 &minus; &lambda;<span class="su">1</span>, x) which satisfies it follow 23
other forms of solution; they involve four series in each of the arguments,
x, x &minus; 1, 1/x, 1/(1 &minus; x), (x &minus; 1)/x, x/(x &minus; 1). Five of the 23
solutions agree with the fundamental solutions already described
about x = 0, x = 1, x = &infin;; and from the principles by which these
were obtained it is immediately clear that the 24 forms are, in value,
equal in fours.</p>

<p>The quarter periods K, K&prime; of Jacobi&rsquo;s theory of elliptic functions,
of which K = &int;<span class="sp1">&pi;/2</span><span class="su1">0</span> (1 &minus; h sin ²&theta;)<span class="sp">&minus;½</span>d&theta;, and K&prime; is the same function of
1-h, can easily be proved to be the solutions of a hypergeometric
<span class="sidenote">Inversion. Modular functions.</span>
equation of which h is the independent variable. When K, K&prime; are
regarded as defined in terms of h by the differential
equation, the ratio K&prime;/K is an infinitely many valued
function of h. But it is remarkable that Jacobi&rsquo;s own
theory of theta functions leads to an expression for h in
terms of K&prime;/K (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Function</a></span>) in terms of single-valued functions.
We may then attempt to investigate, in general, in what cases the
independent variable x of a hypergeometric equation is a single-valued
function of the ratio s of two independent integrals of the equation.
The same inquiry is suggested by the problem of ascertaining in what
cases the hypergeometric series F(&alpha;, &beta;, &gamma;, x) is the expansion of an
algebraic (irrational) function of x. In order to explain the meaning
of the question, suppose that the plane of x is divided along the real
axis from -&infin; to 0 and from 1 to +&infin;, and, supposing logarithms
not to enter about x = 0, choose two quite definite integrals y<span class="su">1</span>, y<span class="su">2</span> of
the equation, say</p>

<p class="center">y<span class="su">1</span> = F(&lambda;, &mu;, 1 &minus; &lambda;<span class="su">1</span>, x),
y<span class="su">2</span> = x<span class="sp">&lambda;1</span> F(&lambda; + &lambda;<span class="su">1</span>, &mu; + &lambda;<span class="su">1</span>, 1 + &lambda;<span class="su">1</span>, x),</p>

<p class="noind">with the condition that the phase of x is zero when x is real
and between 0 and 1. Then the value of &sigmaf; = y<span class="su">2</span>/y<span class="su">1</span> is definite for all
values of x in the divided plane, &sigmaf; being a single-valued monogenic
branch of an analytical function existing and without singularities
all over this region. If, now, the values of &sigmaf; that so arise be plotted
on to another plane, a value p + iq of &sigma; being represented by a point
(p, q) of this &sigmaf;-plane, and the value of x from which it arose being
mentally associated with this point of the &sigma;-plane, these points will
fill a connected region therein, with a continuous boundary formed
of four portions corresponding to the two sides of the two barriers
of the x-plane. The question is then, firstly, whether the same value
of s can arise for two different values of x, that is, whether the same
point (p, q) of the &sigmaf;-plane can arise twice, or in other words, whether
the region of the &sigmaf;-plane overlaps itself or not. Supposing this is not
so, a second part of the question presents itself. If in the x-plane the
barrier joining -&infin; to 0 be momentarily removed, and x describe a
small circle with centre at x = 0 starting from a point x = &minus;h &minus; ik,
where h, k are small, real, and positive and coming back to this point,
the original value s at this point will be changed to a value &sigma;, which in
the original case did not arise for this value of x, and possibly not
at all. If, now, after restoring the barrier the values arising by
continuation from &sigma; be similarly plotted on the &sigmaf;-plane, we shall
again obtain a region which, while not overlapping itself, may quite
possibly overlap the former region. In that case two values of x
would arise for the same value or values of the quotient y<span class="su">2</span>/y<span class="su">1</span>, arising
from two different branches of this quotient. We shall understand
then, by the condition that x is to be a single-valued function of x,
that the region in the &sigmaf;-plane corresponding to any branch is not to
overlap itself, and that no two of the regions corresponding to the
different branches are to overlap. Now in describing the circle
about x = 0 from x =  &minus;h &minus; ik to &minus;h + ik, where h is small and k
evanescent,</p>

<p class="center">&sigmaf; = x<span class="sp">&lambda;1</span> F(&lambda; + &lambda;<span class="su">1</span>, &mu; + &lambda;<span class="su">1</span>, 1 + &lambda;<span class="su">1</span>, x) / F(&lambda;, &mu;, 1 &minus; &lambda;<span class="su">1</span>, x)</p>

<p class="noind">is changed to &sigma; = &sigmaf;e<span class="sp">2&pi;i&lambda;1</span>. Thus the two portions of boundary of the
s-region corresponding to the two sides of the barrier (&minus;&infin;, 0) meet
(at &sigmaf; = 0 if the real part of &lambda;<span class="su">1</span> be positive) at an angle 2&pi;L<span class="su">1</span>, where L<span class="su">1</span>
is the absolute value of the real part of &lambda;<span class="su">1</span>; the same is true for the
&sigma;-region representing the branch &sigma;. The condition that the s-region
shall not overlap itself requires, then, L<span class="su">1</span> = 1. But, further, we may
form an infinite number of branches &sigma; = &sigmaf;e<span class="sp">2&pi;i&lambda;1</span>, &sigma;<span class="su">1</span> = e<span class="sp">2&pi;i&lambda;1</span>, ...
in the same way, and the corresponding regions in the plane upon which
y<span class="su">2</span>/y<span class="su">1</span> is represented will have a common point and each have an
angle 2&pi;L<span class="su">1</span>; if neither overlaps the preceding, it will happen, if L<span class="su">1</span>
is not zero, that at length one is reached overlapping the first, unless
for some positive integer &alpha; we have 2&pi;&alpha;L<span class="su">1</span> = 2&pi;, in other words
L<span class="su">1</span> = 1/&alpha;. If this be so, the branch &sigma;<span class="su">&alpha;&minus;1</span> = &sigmaf;e<span class="sp">2&pi;i&alpha;&lambda;1</span> will be represented
by a region having the angle at the common point common with the
region for the branch &sigmaf;; but not altogether coinciding with this last
region unless &lambda;<span class="su">1</span> be real, and therefore = ±1/&alpha;; then there is only
a finite number, &alpha;, of branches obtainable in this way by crossing
the barrier (&minus;&infin;, 0). In precisely the same way, if we had begun
by taking the quotient</p>

<p class="center">&sigmaf;&prime; = (x &minus; 1)<span class="sp">&lambda;2</span> F(&lambda; + &lambda;<span class="su">2</span>, &mu; + &lambda;<span class="su">2</span>, 1 + &lambda;<span class="su">2</span>, 1 &minus; x) / F(&lambda;, &mu;, 1 &minus; &lambda;<span class="su">2</span>, 1 &minus; x)</p>

<p class="noind">of the two solutions about x = 1, we should have found that x is not
a single-valued function of &sigmaf;&prime; unless &lambda;<span class="su">2</span> is the inverse of an integer, or
is zero; as &sigmaf;&prime; is of the form (A<span class="su">&sigma;</span> + B)/(C<span class="su">&sigmaf;</span> + D), A, B, C, D constants,
the same is true in our case; equally, by considering the integrals
about x = &infin; we find, as a third condition necessary in order that x
may be a single-valued function of &sigmaf;, that &lambda; &minus; &mu; must be the inverse
of an integer or be zero. These three differences of the indices,
namely, &lambda;<span class="su">1</span>, &lambda;<span class="su">2</span>, &lambda; &minus; &mu;, are the quantities which enter in the differential
equation satisfied by x as a function of &sigmaf;, which is easily found to be</p>

the converse question whether the three conditions are sufficient
to ensure (1) that the &sigma; region corresponding to any branch does
not overlap itself, (2) that no two such regions overlap, we have no
space to enter. The second question clearly requires the inquiry
whether the group (that is, the monodromy group) of the differential
equation is properly discontinuous. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Groups, Theory of</a></span>.)</p>

<p>The foregoing account will give an idea of the nature of the
function theories of differential equations; it appears essential
not to exclude some explanation of a theory intimately related
both to such theories and to transformation theories, which is a
generalization of Galois&rsquo;s theory of algebraic equations. We deal
only with the application to homogeneous linear differential
equations.</p>

<p>In general a function of variables x<span class="su">1</span>, x<span class="su">2</span> ... is said to be rational
when it can be formed from them and the integers 1, 2, 3, ... by a
finite number of additions, subtractions, multiplications
and divisions. We generalize this definition. Assume that
<span class="sidenote">Rationality group of a linear equation.</span>
we have assigned a fundamental series of quantities and
functions of x, in which x itself is included, such that all
quantities formed by a finite number of additions, subtractions,
multiplications, divisions <i>and differentiations in regard to x</i>,
of the terms of this series, are themselves members of this series.
Then the quantities of this series, and only these, are called <i>rational</i>.
By a rational function of quantities p, q, r, ... is meant a function
formed from them and any of the fundamental rational quantities
by a finite number of the five fundamental operations. Thus it is a
function which would be called, simply, rational if the fundamental
series were widened by the addition to it of the quantities p, q, r, ...
and those derivable from them by the five fundamental operations.
A rational ordinary differential equation, with x as independent and
y as dependent variable, is then one which equates to zero a rational
function of y, the order k of the differential equation being that of the
highest differential coefficient y<span class="sp">(k)</span> which enters; only such equations
are here discussed. Such an equation P = 0 is called <i>irreducible</i> when,
firstly, being arranged as an integral polynomial in y<span class="sp">(k)</span>, this polynomial
<span class="sidenote">Irreducibility of a rational equation.</span>
is not the product of other polynomials in y<span class="sp">(k)</span> also
of rational form; and, secondly, the equation has no
solution satisfying also a rational equation of lower order.
From this it follows that if an irreducible equation P = 0
have one solution satisfying another rational equation Q = 0
of the same or higher order, then all the solutions of P = 0 also satisfy
Q = 0. For from the equation P = 0 we can by differentiation express
y<span class="sp">(k+1)</span>, y<span class="sp">(k+2)</span>, ... in terms of x, y, y<span class="sp">(1)</span>, ... , y<span class="sp">(k)</span>, and so put the
function Q rationally in terms of these quantities only. It is
sufficient, then, to prove the result when the equation Q = 0 is of the
same order as P = 0. Let both the equations be arranged as integral
polynomials in y<span class="sp">(k)</span>; their algebraic eliminant in regard to y<span class="sp">(k)</span> must
then vanish identically, for they are known to have one common
solution not satisfying an equation of lower order; thus the equation
P = 0 involves Q = 0 for all solutions of P = 0.</p>

<p>Now let y<span class="sp">(n)</span> = a<span class="su">1</span>y<span class="sp">(n&minus;1)</span> + ... + a<span class="su">n</span>y be a given rational homogeneous
linear differential equation; let y<span class="su">1</span>, ... y<span class="su">n</span> be n particular
functions of x, unconnected by any equation with constant coefficients
of the form c<span class="su">1</span>y<span class="su">1</span> + ... + c<span class="su">n</span>y<span class="su">n</span> = 0, all satisfying
<span class="sidenote">The variant function for a linear equation.</span>
the differential equation; let &eta;<span class="su">1</span>, ... &eta;<span class="su">n</span> be linear functions
of y<span class="su">1</span>, ... y<span class="su">n</span>, say &eta;<span class="su">i</span> = A<span class="su">i1</span>y<span class="su">1</span> + ... + A<span class="su">in</span>y<span class="su">n</span>, where the
constant coefficients A<span class="su">ij</span> have a non-vanishing determinant;
write (&eta;) = A(y), these being the equations of a
general linear homogeneous group whose transformations
may be denoted by A, B, .... We desire to form a
rational function &phi;(&eta;), or say &phi;(A(y)), of &eta;<span class="su">1</span>, ... &eta;, in which the
&eta;² constants A<span class="su">ij</span> shall all be essential, and not reduce effectively to a
fewer number, as they would, for instance, if the y<span class="su">1</span>, ... y<span class="su">n</span> were
connected by a linear equation with constant coefficients. Such a
function is in fact given, if the solutions y<span class="su">1</span>, ... y<span class="su">n</span> be developable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>238</span>
in positive integral powers about x = a, by &phi;(&eta;) = &eta;<span class="su">1</span> + (x &minus; a)<span class="sp">n</span> &eta;<span class="su">2</span> + ... +
(x &minus; a)<span class="sp">(n&minus;1)n</span> &eta;<span class="su">n</span>. Such a function, V, we call a <i>variant</i>.</p>

<p>Then differentiating V in regard to x, and replacing &eta;<span class="su">i</span><span class="sp">(n)</span> by its
value a<span class="su">1</span>&eta;<span class="sp">(n&minus;1)</span> + ... + a<span class="su">n</span>&eta;, we can arrange dV/dx, and similarly each
of d²/dx² ... d<span class="sp">N</span>V/dx<span class="sp">N</span>, where N = n², as a linear function of
the N quantities &eta;<span class="su">1</span>, ... &eta;<span class="su">n</span>, ... &eta;<span class="su">1</span><span class="sp">(n&minus;1)</span>, ... &eta;<span class="su">n</span><span class="sp">(n&minus;1)</span>, and
<span class="sidenote">The resolvent eqution.</span>
thence by elimination obtain a linear differential equation
for V of order N with rational coefficients. This we
denote by F = 0. Further, each of &eta;<span class="su">1</span> ... &eta;<span class="su">n</span> is expressible
as a linear function of V, dV/dx, ... d<span class="sp">N&minus;1</span>V / dx<span class="sp">N&minus;1</span>, with rational coefficients
not involving any of the n² coefficients A<span class="su">ij</span>, since otherwise
V would satisfy a linear equation of order less than N, which is
impossible, as it involves (linearly) the n² arbitrary coefficients A<span class="su">ij</span>,
which would not enter into the coefficients of the supposed equation.
In particular, y<span class="su">1</span> ,.. y<span class="su">n</span> are expressible rationally as linear functions
of &omega;, d&omega;/dx, ... d<span class="sp">N&minus;1</span>&omega; / dx<span class="sp">N&minus;1</span>, where &omega; is the particular function
&phi;(y). Any solution W of the equation F = 0 is derivable from
functions &zeta;<span class="su">1</span>, ... &zeta;<span class="su">n</span>, which are linear functions of y<span class="su">1</span>, ... y<span class="su">n</span>, just
as V was derived from &eta;<span class="su">1</span>, ... &eta;<span class="su">n</span>; but it does not follow that these
functions &zeta;<span class="su">i</span>, ... &zeta;<span class="su">n</span> are obtained from y<span class="su">1</span>, ... y<span class="su">n</span> by a transformation
of the linear group A, B, ... ; for it may happen that the
determinant d(&zeta;<span class="su">1</span>, ... &zeta;<span class="su">n</span>) / (dy<span class="su">1</span>, ... y<span class="su">n</span>) is zero. In that case
&zeta;<span class="su">1</span>, ... &zeta;<span class="su">n</span> may be called a singular set, and W a singular solution; it
satisfies an equation of lower than the N-th order. But every solution
V, W, ordinary or singular, of the equation F = 0, is expressible
rationally in terms of &omega;, d&omega; / dx, ... d<span class="sp">N&minus;1</span>&omega; / dx<span class="sp">N&minus;1</span>; we shall write,
simply, V = r(&omega;). Consider now the rational irreducible equation
of lowest order, not necessarily a linear equation, which is satisfied
by &omega;; as y<span class="su">1</span>, ... y<span class="su">n</span> are particular functions, it may quite well
be of order less than N; we call it the <i>resolvent equation</i>, suppose it
of order p, and denote it by &gamma;(v). Upon it the whole theory turns.
In the first place, as &gamma;(v)  = 0 is satisfied by the solution &omega; of F  = 0, all
the solutions of &gamma;(v) are solutions F = 0, and are therefore rationally
expressible by &omega;; any one may then be denoted by r(&omega;). If this
solution of F = 0 be not singular, it corresponds to a transformation
A of the linear group (A, B, ...), effected upon y<span class="su">1</span>, ... y<span class="su">n</span>. The
coefficients A<span class="su">ij</span> of this transformation follow from the expressions
before mentioned for &eta;<span class="su">1</span> ... &eta;<span class="su">n</span> in terms of V, dV/dx, d²V/dx², ... by
substituting V = r(&omega;); thus they depend on the p arbitrary parameters
which enter into the general expression for the integral of
the equation &gamma;(v)  = 0. Without going into further details, it is then
clear enough that the resolvent equation, being irreducible and such
that any solution is expressible rationally, with p parameters, in
terms of the solution &omega;, enables us to define a linear homogeneous
group of transformations of y<span class="su">1</span> ... y<span class="su">n</span> depending on p parameters;
and every operation of this (continuous) group corresponds to a
rational transformation of the solution of the resolvent equation.
This is the group called the <i>rationality group</i>, or the <i>group of transformations</i>
of the original homogeneous linear differential equation.</p>

<p>The group must not be confounded with a subgroup of itself,
the <i>monodromy group</i> of the equation, often called simply the group
of the equation, which is a set of transformations, not depending
on arbitrary variable parameters, arising for one particular
fundamental set of solutions of the linear equation (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Groups,
Theory of</a></span>).</p>

<p>The importance of the rationality group consists in three propositions.
(1) Any rational function of y<span class="su">1</span>, ... y<span class="su">n</span> which is unaltered in
value by the transformations of the group can be written
in rational form. (2) If any rational function be changed
<span class="sidenote">The fundamental theorem in regard to the rationality group.</span>
in form, becoming a rational function of y<span class="su">1</span>, ... y<span class="su">n</span>, a
transformation of the group applied to its new form will
leave its value unaltered. (3) Any homogeneous linear
transformation leaving unaltered the value of every
rational function of y<span class="su">1</span>, ... y<span class="su">n</span> which has a rational value,
belongs to the group. It follows from these that any
group of linear homogeneous transformations having the
properties (1) (2) is identical with the group in question. It is clear
that with these properties the group must be of the greatest importance
in attempting to discover what functions of x must be regarded as
rational in order that the values of y<span class="su">1</span> ... y<span class="su">n</span> may be expressed.
And this is the problem of solving the equation from another point
of view.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIFFRACTION OF LIGHT.<a name="ar84" id="ar84"></a></span>&mdash;1. When light proceeding from
a small source falls upon an opaque object, a shadow is cast upon
a screen situated behind the obstacle, and this shadow is found to
be bordered by alternations of brightness and darkness, known
as &ldquo;diffraction bands.&rdquo; The phenomena thus presented were
described by Grimaldi and by Newton. Subsequently T. Young
showed that in their formation interference plays an important
part, but the complete explanation was reserved for A. J. Fresnel.
Later investigations by Fraunhofer, Airy and others have
greatly widened the field, and under the head of &ldquo;diffraction&rdquo;
are now usually treated all the effects dependent upon the
limitation of a beam of light, as well as those which arise from
irregularities of any kind at surfaces through which it is transmitted,
or at which it is reflected.</p>

<p>2. <i>Shadows.</i>&mdash;In the infancy of the undulatory theory the
objection most frequently urged against it was the difficulty of
explaining the very existence of shadows. Thanks to Fresnel
and his followers, this department of optics is now precisely the
one in which the theory has gained its greatest triumphs. The
principle employed in these investigations is due to C. Huygens,
and may be thus formulated. If round the origin of waves an
ideal closed surface be drawn, the whole action of the waves in the
region beyond may be regarded as due to the motion continually
propagated across the various elements of this surface. The wave
motion due to any element of the surface is called a <i>secondary</i>
wave, and in estimating the total effect regard must be paid to the
phases as well as the amplitudes of the components. It is usually
convenient to choose as the surface of resolution a <i>wave-front</i>, <i>i.e.</i>
a surface at which the primary vibrations are in one phase. Any
obscurity that may hang over Huygens&rsquo;s principle is due mainly to
the indefiniteness of thought and expression which we must be
content to put up with if we wish to avoid pledging ourselves as
to the character of the vibrations. In the application to sound,
where we know what we are dealing with, the matter is simple
enough in principle, although mathematical difficulties would
often stand in the way of the calculations we might wish to make.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>239</span>
The ideal surface of resolution may be there regarded as a flexible
lamina; and we know that, if by forces locally applied every
element of the lamina be made to move normally to itself exactly
as the air at that place does, the external aerial motion is fully
determined. By the principle of superposition the whole effect
may be found by integration of the partial effects due to each
element of the surface, the other elements remaining at rest.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="float: left; width: 220px;" summary="Illustration">

<p>We will now consider in detail the important case in which uniform
plane waves are resolved at a surface coincident with a wave-front
(OQ). We imagine a wave-front divided
into elementary rings or zones&mdash;often named
after Huygens, but better after Fresnel&mdash;by
spheres described round P (the point at
which the aggregate effect is to be estimated),
the first sphere, touching the plane at O, with
a radius equal to PO, and the succeeding
spheres with radii increasing at each step
by ½&lambda;. There are thus marked out a series
of circles, whose radii x are given by
x² + r² = (r +  ½n&lambda;)², or x² = n&lambda;r nearly; so that
the rings are at first of nearly equal area.
Now the effect upon P of each element of the
plane is proportional to its area; but it
depends also upon the distance from P, and possibly upon the
inclination of the secondary ray to the direction of vibration and
to the wave-front.</p>

<p>The latter question can only be treated in connexion with the
dynamical theory (see below, § 11); but under all ordinary circumstances
the result is independent of the precise answer that may be
given. All that it is necessary to assume is that the effects of the
successive zones gradually diminish, whether from the increasing
obliquity of the secondary ray or because (on account of the limitation
of the region of integration) the zones become at last more and
more incomplete. The component vibrations at P due to the
successive zones are thus nearly equal in amplitude and opposite in
phase (the phase of each corresponding to that of the infinitesimal
circle midway between the boundaries), and the series which we have
to sum is one in which the terms are alternately opposite in sign
and, while at first nearly constant in numerical magnitude, gradually
diminish to zero. In such a series each term may be regarded as very
nearly indeed destroyed by the halves of its immediate neighbours,
and thus the sum of the whole series is represented by half the first
term, which stands over uncompensated. The question is thus
reduced to that of finding the effect of the first zone, or central
circle, of which the area is &pi;&lambda;r.</p>

<p>We have seen that the problem before us is independent of the
law of the secondary wave as regards obliquity; but the result of
the integration necessarily involves the law of the intensity and
phase of a secondary wave as a function of r, the distance from the
origin. And we may in fact, as was done by A. Smith (<i>Camb. Math.
Journ.</i>, 1843, 3, p. 46), determine the law of the secondary wave, by
comparing the result of the integration with that obtained by supposing
the primary wave to pass on to P without resolution.</p>

<p>Now as to the phase of the secondary wave, it might appear
natural to suppose that it starts from any point Q with the phase
of the primary wave, so that on arrival at P, it is retarded by the
amount corresponding to QP. But a little consideration will prove
that in that case the series of secondary waves could not reconstitute
the primary wave. For the aggregate effect of the secondary waves
is the half of that of the first Fresnel zone, and it is the central
element only of that zone for which the distance to be travelled is
equal to r. Let us conceive the zone in question to be divided
into infinitesimal rings of equal area. The effects due to each of
these rings are equal in amplitude and of phase ranging uniformly
over half a complete period. The phase of the resultant is midway
between those of the extreme elements, that is to say, a quarter of
a period behind that due to the element at the centre of the circle.
It is accordingly necessary to suppose that the secondary waves
start with a phase one-quarter of a period in advance of that of the
primary wave at the surface of resolution.</p>

<p>Further, it is evident that account must be taken of the variation
of phase in estimating the magnitude of the effect at P of the first
zone. The middle element alone contributes without deduction;
the effect of every other must be found by introduction of a resolving
factor, equal to cos &theta;, if &theta; represent the difference of phase
between this element and the resultant. Accordingly, the amplitude
of the resultant will be less than if all its components had the same
phase, in the ratio</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr><td class="np" rowspan="2"><span class="f200">&int;</span></td> <td>+½&pi;</td>
<td rowspan="2">cos &theta;d&theta; : &pi;,</td></tr>
<tr><td>-½&pi;</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">or 2 : &pi;. Now 2 area /&pi; = 2&lambda;r; so that, in order to reconcile the
amplitude of the primary wave (taken as unity) with the half effect
of the first zone, the amplitude, at distance r, of the secondary wave
emitted from the element of area dS must be taken to be</p>

<p class="center">dS/&lambda;r &emsp; &emsp; (1).</p>

<p class="noind">By this expression, in conjunction with the quarter-period acceleration
of phase, the law of the secondary wave is determined.</p>

<p>That the amplitude of the secondary wave should vary as r<span class="sp">-1</span> was
to be expected from considerations respecting energy; but the
occurrence of the factor &lambda;<span class="sp">-1</span>, and the acceleration of phase, have
sometimes been regarded as mysterious. It may be well therefore
to remember that precisely these laws apply to a secondary wave
of sound, which can be investigated upon the strictest mechanical
principles.</p>

<p>The recomposition of the secondary waves may also be treated
analytically. If the primary wave at O be cos kat, the effect of the
secondary wave proceeding from the element dS at Q is</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr><td>dS</td> <td rowspan="2">cos k(at &minus; &rho; + ¼&lambda;) = &minus;</td> <td>dS</td>

<td rowspan="2">.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="bk">r</td> <td class="bk">r</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">In order to obtain the effect of the primary wave, as retarded by
traversing the distance r, viz. cos k(at &minus; r), it is necessary to suppose
that the integrated term vanishes at the upper limit. And it is important
to notice that without some further understanding the
integral is really ambiguous. According to the assumed law of
the secondary wave, the result must actually depend upon the
precise radius of the outer boundary of the region of integration,
supposed to be exactly circular. This case is, however, at most
very special and exceptional. We may usually suppose that a large
number of the outer rings are incomplete, so that the integrated term
at the upper limit may properly be taken to vanish. If a formal
proof be desired, it may be obtained by introducing into the integral
a factor such as e<span class="sp">-h&rho;</span>, in which h is ultimately made to diminish
without limit.</p>

<p>When the primary wave is plane, the area of the first Fresnel
zone is &pi;&lambda;r, and, since the secondary waves vary as r<span class="sp">-1</span>, the intensity
is independent of r, as of course it should be. If, however, the
primary wave be spherical, and of radius a at the wave-front of
resolution, then we know that at a distance r further on the
amplitude of the primary wave will be diminished in the ratio
a : (r + a). This may be regarded as a consequence of the altered
area of the first Fresnel zone. For, if x be its radius, we have</p>

<p class="center">{(r + ½&lambda;)² &minus; x²} + &radic; {a² &minus; x²} = r + a,</p>

<p class="noind">so that</p>

<p class="center">x² = &lambda;ar/(a + r) nearly.</p>

<p class="noind">Since the distance to be travelled by the secondary waves is still
r, we see how the effect of the first zone, and therefore of the whole
series is proportional to a/(a + r). In like manner may be treated
other cases, such as that of a primary wave-front of unequal principal
curvatures.</p>

<p>The general explanation of the formation of shadows may also
be conveniently based upon Fresnel&rsquo;s zones. If the point under
consideration be so far away from the geometrical shadow that a
large number of the earlier zones are complete, then the illumination,
determined sensibly by the first zone, is the same as if there
were no obstruction at all. If, on the other hand, the point be well
immersed in the geometrical shadow, the earlier zones are altogether
missing, and, instead of a series of terms beginning with finite
numerical magnitude and gradually diminishing to zero, we have
now to deal with one of which the terms diminish to zero <i>at both
ends</i>. The sum of such a series is very approximately zero, each term
being neutralized by the halves of its immediate neighbours, which
are of the opposite sign. The question of light or darkness then
depends upon whether the series begins or ends abruptly. With few
exceptions, abruptness can occur only in the presence of the first
term, viz. when the secondary wave of least retardation is unobstructed,
or when a <i>ray</i> passes through the point under consideration.
According to the undulatory theory the light cannot be regarded
strictly as travelling along a ray; but the existence of an unobstructed
ray implies that the system of Fresnel&rsquo;s zones can be commenced,
and, if a large number of these zones are fully developed and do not
terminate abruptly, the illumination is unaffected by the neighbourhood
of obstacles. Intermediate cases in which a few zones only are
formed belong especially to the province of diffraction.</p>

<p>An interesting exception to the general rule that full brightness
requires the existence of the first zone occurs when the obstacle
assumes the form of a small circular disk parallel to the plane of
the incident waves. In the earlier half of the 18th century R. Delisle
found that the centre of the circular shadow was occupied by a
bright point of light, but the observation passed into oblivion
until S. D. Poisson brought forward as an objection to Fresnel&rsquo;s
theory that it required at the centre of a circular shadow a point as
bright as if no obstacle were intervening. If we conceive the primary
wave to be broken up at the plane of the disk, a system of Fresnel&rsquo;s
zones can be constructed which begin from the circumference;
and the first zone external to the disk plays the part ordinarily
taken by the centre of the entire system. The whole effect is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>240</span>
half of that of the first existing zone, and this is sensibly the same
as if there were no obstruction.</p>

<p>When light passes through a small circular or annular aperture,
the illumination at any point along the axis depends upon the
precise relation between the aperture and the distance from it at
which the point is taken. If, as in the last paragraph, we imagine
a system of zones to be drawn commencing from the inner circular
boundary of the aperture, the question turns upon the manner in
which the series terminates at the outer boundary. If the aperture
be such as to fit exactly an integral number of zones, the aggregate
effect may be regarded as the half of those due to the first and last
zones. If the number of zones be even, the action of the first and last
zones are antagonistic, and there is complete darkness at the point.
If on the other hand the number of zones be odd, the effects conspire;
and the illumination (proportional to the square of the amplitude)
is four times as great as if there were no obstruction at all.</p>

<p>The process of augmenting the resultant illumination at a particular
point by stopping some of the secondary rays may be carried
much further (Soret, <i>Pogg. Ann.</i>, 1875, 156, p. 99). By the aid of
photography it is easy to prepare a plate, transparent where the zones
of odd order fall, and opaque where those of even order fall. Such
a plate has the power of a condensing lens, and gives an illumination
out of all proportion to what could be obtained without it. An even
greater effect (fourfold) can be attained by providing that the
stoppage of the light from the alternate zones is replaced by a
phase-reversal without loss of amplitude. R. W. Wood (<i>Phil. Mag.</i>,
1898, 45, p 513) has succeeded in constructing zone plates upon this
principle.</p>

<p>In such experiments the narrowness of the zones renders necessary
a pretty close approximation to the geometrical conditions. Thus
in the case of the circular disk, equidistant (r) from the source of
light and from the screen upon which the shadow is observed, the
width of the first exterior zone is given by</p>

<p class="center">dx = &lambda;(2r)/4(2x),</p>

<p>2x being the diameter of the disk. If 2r = 1000 cm., 2x = 1 cm.,
&lambda; = 6 × 10<span class="sp">-5</span> cm., then dx = .0015 cm. Hence, in order that this
zone may be perfectly formed, there should be no error in the circumference
of the order of .001 cm. (It is easy to see that the radius of
the bright spot is of the same order of magnitude.) The experiment
succeeds in a dark room of the length above mentioned, with a
threepenny bit (supported by three threads) as obstacle, the origin
of light being a small needle hole in a plate of tin, through which the
sun&rsquo;s rays shine horizontally after reflection from an external mirror.
In the absence of a heliostat it is more convenient to obtain a point of
light with the aid of a lens of short focus.</p>

<p>The amplitude of the light at any point in the axis, when plane
waves are incident perpendicularly upon an annular aperture, is,
as above,</p>

<p class="center">cos k(at &minus; r<span class="su">1</span>) &minus; cos k(at &minus; r<span class="su">2</span>) = 2 sin kat sin k(r<span class="su">1</span> &minus; r<span class="su">2</span>),</p>

<p class="noind">r<span class="su">2</span>, r<span class="su">1</span> being the distances of the outer and inner boundaries
from the point in question. It is scarcely necessary to remark
that in all such cases the calculation applies in the first instance
to homogeneous light, and that, in accordance with Fourier&rsquo;s
theorem, each homogeneous component of a mixture may be treated
separately. When the original light is white, the presence of some
components and the absence of others will
usually give rise to coloured effects, variable
with the precise circumstances of the case.</p>

<tr><td class="caption sc">Fig. 2.</td></tr></table>

<p>Although the matter can be fully treated
only upon the basis of a dynamical theory, it
is proper to point out at once that there is an
element of assumption in the application of
Huygens&rsquo;s principle to the calculation of the
effects produced by opaque screens of limited
extent. Properly applied, the principle could
not fail; but, as may readily be proved in
the case of sonorous waves, it is not in strictness
sufficient to assume the expression for
a secondary wave suitable when the primary
wave is undisturbed, with mere limitation of
the integration to the transparent parts of the screen. But, except
perhaps in the case of very fine gratings, it is probable that the error
thus caused is insignificant; for the incorrect estimation of the
secondary waves will be limited to distances of a few wave-lengths
only from the boundary of opaque and transparent parts.</p>

<p>3. <i>Fraunhofer&rsquo;s Diffraction Phenomena.</i>&mdash;A very general
problem in diffraction is the investigation of the distribution
of light over a screen upon which impinge divergent or convergent
spherical waves after passage through various diffracting
apertures. When the waves are convergent and the recipient
screen is placed so as to contain the centre of convergency&mdash;the
image of the original radiant point, the calculation assumes a less

by J. von Fraunhofer (upon principles laid down by Fresnel),

commence with them on account of their simplicity and great
importance in respect to the theory of optical instruments.</p>

<p class="noind">This expression for the intensity becomes rigorously applicable when
&fnof; is indefinitely great, so that ordinary optical aberration disappears.
The incident waves are thus plane, and are limited to a plane aperture
coincident with a wave-front. The integrals are then properly
functions of the <i>direction</i> in which the light is to be estimated.</p>

<p>In experiment under ordinary circumstances it makes no difference
whether the collecting lens is in front of or behind the diffracting
aperture. It is usually most convenient to employ a telescope
focused upon the radiant point, and to place the diffracting apertures
immediately in front of the object-glass. What is seen through the
eye-piece in any case is the same as would be depicted upon a screen
in the focal plane.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to special cases it may be well to call attention
to some general properties of the solution expressed by (2) (see
Bridge, <i>Phil. Mag.</i>, 1858).</p>

<p>If when the aperture is given, the wave-length (proportional to
k<span class="sp">-1</span>) varies, the composition of the integrals is unaltered, provided
&xi; and &eta; are taken universely proportional to &lambda;. A diminution of
&lambda; thus leads to a simple proportional shrinkage of the diffraction
pattern, attended by an augmentation of brilliancy in proportion
to &lambda;<span class="sp">-2</span>.</p>

<p>If the wave-length remains unchanged, similar effects are produced
by an increase in the scale of the aperture. The linear
dimension of the diffraction pattern is inversely as that of the
aperture, and the brightness at corresponding points is as the
<i>square</i> of the area of aperture.</p>

<p>If the aperture and wave-length increase in the same proportion,
the size and shape of the diffraction pattern undergo no change.</p>

<p>We will now apply the integrals (2) to the case of a rectangular
aperture of width a parallel to x and of width b parallel to y. The
limits of integration for x may thus be taken to be &minus;½a and +½a,
and for y to be &minus;½b, +½b. We readily find (with substitution for
k of 2&pi;/&lambda;)</p>

<p>The application of these results to (3) shows that the field is
brightest at the centre &xi; = 0, &eta; = 0, viz. at the geometrical image
of the radiant point. It is traversed by dark lines whose equations
are</p>

<p class="center">&xi; = mf&lambda; / a, &eta; = mf&lambda; / b.</p>

<p class="noind">Within the rectangle formed by pairs of consecutive dark lines,
and not far from its centre, the brightness rises to a maximum;
but these subsequent maxima are in all cases much inferior to the
brightness at the centre of the entire pattern (&xi; = 0, &eta; = 0).</p>

<p>By the principle of energy the illumination over the entire focal
plane must be equal to that over the diffracting area; and thus, in
accordance with the suppositions by which (3) was obtained, its
value when integrated from &xi; = &infin; to &xi; = +&infin;, and from &eta; = &minus;&infin;
to &eta; = +&infin; should be equal to ab. This integration, employed
originally by P. Kelland (<i>Edin. Trans.</i> 15, p. 315) to determine the
absolute intensity of a secondary wave, may be at once effected by
means of the known formula</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">

<p class="noind">It will be observed that, while the total intensity is proportional to
ab, the intensity at the focal point is proportional to a²b². If the
aperture be increased, not only is the total brightness over the focal
plane increased with it, but there is also a concentration of the
diffraction pattern. The form of (3) shows immediately that, if
a and b be altered, the co-ordinates of any characteristic point in the
pattern vary as a<span class="sp">&minus;1</span> and b<span class="sp">&minus;1</span>.</p>

<p>The contraction of the diffraction pattern with increase of aperture
is of fundamental importance in connexion with the resolving power
of optical instruments. According to common optics, where images
are absolute, the diffraction pattern is supposed to be infinitely
small, and two radiant points, however near together, form separated
images. This is tantamount to an assumption that &lambda; is infinitely
small. The actual finiteness of &lambda; imposes a limit upon the separating
or resolving power of an optical instrument.</p>

<p>This indefiniteness of images is sometimes said to be due to
diffraction by the edge of the aperture, and proposals have even been
made for curing it by causing the transition between the interrupted
and transmitted parts of the primary wave to be less abrupt. Such
a view of the matter is altogether misleading. What requires
explanation is not the imperfection of actual images so much as the
possibility of their being as good as we find them.</p>

<p>At the focal point (&xi; = 0, &eta; = 0) all the secondary waves agree in
phase, and the intensity is easily expressed, whatever be the form
of the aperture. From the general formula (2), if A be the <i>area</i> of
aperture,</p>

<p class="center">I<span class="su">0</span>² = A² / &lambda;²&fnof;² &emsp; &emsp; (7).</p>

<p>The formation of a sharp image of the radiant point requires
that the illumination become insignificant when &xi;, &eta; attain small
values, and this insignificance can only arise as a consequence of
discrepancies of phase among the secondary waves from various
parts of the aperture. So long as there is no sensible discrepancy
of phase there can be no sensible diminution of brightness as compared
with that to be found at the focal point itself. We may go
further, and lay it down that there can be no considerable loss of
brightness until the difference of phase of the waves proceeding from
the nearest and farthest parts of the aperture amounts to ¼&lambda;.</p>

<p>When the difference of phase amounts to &lambda;, we may expect the
resultant illumination to be very much reduced. In the particular
case of a rectangular aperture the course of things can be readily
followed, especially if we conceive &fnof; to be infinite. In the direction
(suppose horizontal) for which &eta; = 0, &xi;/&fnof; = sin &theta;, the phases of the
secondary waves range over a complete period when sin &theta; = &lambda;/a, and,
since all parts of the horizontal aperture are equally effective, there
is in this direction a complete compensation and consequent absence
of illumination. When sin &theta; = <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>&lambda;/a, the phases range one and a half
periods, and there is revival of illumination. We may compare
the brightness with that in the direction &theta; = 0. The phase of the
resultant amplitude is the same as that due to the central secondary
wave, and the discrepancies of phase among the components reduce
the amplitude in the proportion</p>

maximum at &theta; = 0. In like manner we may find the illumination
in any other direction, and it is obvious that it vanishes when sin &theta;
is any multiple of &lambda;/a.</p>

<p>The reason of the augmentation of resolving power with aperture
will now be evident. The larger the aperture the smaller are the
angles through which it is necessary to deviate from the principal
direction in order to bring in specified discrepancies of phase&mdash;the
more concentrated is the image.</p>

<p>In many cases the subject of examination is a luminous line of
uniform intensity, the various points of which are to be treated as
independent sources of light. If the image of the line be &xi; = 0,
the intensity at any point &xi;, &eta; of the diffraction pattern may be
represented by</p>

<p class="noind">the same law as obtains for a luminous point when horizontal
directions are alone considered. The definition of a fine vertical
line, and consequently the resolving power for contiguous vertical
lines, is thus <i>independent of the vertical aperture of the instrument</i>,
a law of great importance in the theory of the spectroscope.</p>

<p>The distribution of illumination in the image of a luminous line
is shown by the curve ABC (fig. 3), representing the value of the
function sin²u/u² from u = 0 to u = 2&pi;. The part corresponding to
negative values of u is similar, OA being a line of symmetry.</p>

<p>Let us now consider the distribution of brightness in the image
of a double line whose components are of equal strength, and at
such an angular interval that the central line in the image of one
coincides with the first zero of brightness in the image of the other.
In fig. 3 the curve of brightness for one component is ABC, and
for the other OA&prime;C&prime;; and the curve representing half the combined
brightnesses is E&prime;BE. The brightness (corresponding
to B) midway between the two
central points AA&rsquo; is .8106 of the brightness
at the central points themselves. We
may consider this to be about the limit of
closeness at which there could be any
decided appearance of resolution, though
doubtless an observer accustomed to his
instrument would recognize the duplicity
with certainty. The obliquity, corresponding
to u = &pi;, is such that the phases
of the secondary waves range over a complete
period, <i>i.e.</i> such that the projection of
the horizontal aperture upon this direction
is one wave-length. We conclude that a <i>double line cannot be
fairly resolved unless its components subtend an angle exceeding that
subtended by the wave-length of light at a distance equal to the horizontal
aperture</i>. This rule is convenient on account of its simplicity; and
it is sufficiently accurate in view of the necessary uncertainty as to
what exactly is meant by resolution.</p>

<p>If the angular interval between the components of a double line
be half as great again as that supposed in the figure, the brightness
midway between is .1802 as against 1.0450 at the central lines of
each image. Such a falling off in the middle must be more than
sufficient for resolution. If the angle subtended by the components
of a double line be twice that subtended by the wave-length at a
distance equal to the horizontal aperture, the central bands are
just clear of one another, and there is a line of absolute blackness
in the middle of the combined images.</p>

<p>The resolving power of a telescope with circular or rectangular
aperture is easily investigated experimentally. The best object for
examination is a grating of fine wires, about fifty to the inch, backed
by a sodium flame. The object-glass is provided with diaphragms
pierced with round holes or slits. One of these, of width equal, say,
to one-tenth of an inch, is inserted in front of the object-glass, and
the telescope, carefully focused all the while, is drawn gradually back
from the grating until the lines are no longer seen. From a measurement
of the maximum distance the least angle between consecutive
lines consistent with resolution may be deduced, and a comparison
made with the rule stated above.</p>

<p>Merely to show the dependence of resolving power on aperture it is
not necessary to use a telescope at all. It is sufficient to look at wire
gauze backed by the sky or by a flame, through a piece of blackened
cardboard, pierced by a needle and held close to the eye. By
varying the distance the point is easily found at which resolution
ceases; and the observation is as sharp as with a telescope. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>242</span>
function of the telescope is in fact to allow the use of a wider, and
therefore more easily measurable, aperture. An interesting modification
of the experiment may be made by using light of various
wave-lengths.</p>

<p>Since the limitation of the width of the central band in the image
of a luminous line depends upon discrepancies of phase among the
secondary waves, and since the discrepancy is greatest for the waves
which come from the edges of the aperture, the question arises
how far the operation of the central parts of the aperture is advantageous.
If we imagine the aperture reduced to two equal
narrow slits bordering its edges, compensation will evidently be
complete when the projection on an oblique direction is equal to
½&lambda;, instead of &lambda; as for the complete aperture. By this procedure
the width of the central band in the diffraction pattern is halved,
and so far an advantage is attained. But, as will be evident, the
bright bands bordering the central band are now not inferior to it
in brightness; in fact, a band similar to the central band is reproduced
an indefinite number of times, so long as there is no sensible
discrepancy of phase in the secondary waves proceeding from the
various parts of the <i>same</i> slit. Under these circumstances the
narrowing of the band is paid for at a ruinous price, and the arrangement
must be condemned altogether.</p>

<p>A more moderate suppression of the central parts is, however,
sometimes advantageous. Theory and experiment alike prove that
a double line, of which the components are equally strong, is better
resolved when, for example, one-sixth of the horizontal aperture is
blocked off by a central screen; or the rays quite at the centre may
be allowed to pass, while others a little farther removed are blocked
off. Stops, each occupying one-eighth of the width, and with centres
situated at the points of trisection, answer well the required purpose.</p>

<p>It has already been suggested that the principle of energy requires
that the general expression for I² in (2) when integrated over the
whole of the plane &xi;, &eta; should be equal to A, where A is the area of
the aperture. A general analytical verification has been given by
Sir G. G. Stokes (<i>Edin. Trans.</i>, 1853, 20, p. 317). Analytically
expressed&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">the relation between A and A&prime; is AA&prime; = &lambda;²f². Since A&prime; is in some
sense the area of the diffraction pattern, it may be considered to be a
rough criterion of the definition, and we infer that the definition of a

a very secondary degree upon the shape when the area is maintained
constant.</p>

<p>In both cases the image of a mathematical point is thus a
symmetrical ring system. The greatest brightness is at the centre,
where</p>

<p class="center">dC = 2&pi;&rho; d&rho;, C = &pi; R².</p>

<p class="noind">For a certain distance outwards this remains sensibly unimpaired
and then gradually diminishes to zero, as the secondary waves
become discrepant in phase. The subsequent revivals of brightness
forming the bright rings are necessarily of inferior brilliancy as
compared with the central disk.</p>

circular aperture occurs when</p>

central parts, the compensation in the case of the circle does not
set in at so small an obliquity as when the circle is replaced by a
rectangular aperture, whose side is equal to the diameter of the

<p>Again, if we compare the complete circle with a narrow annular
aperture of the same radius, we see that in the latter case the first
dark ring occurs at a much smaller obliquity, viz.</p>

<p class="center">r/&fnof; = .7655 × &lambda;/2R.</p>

<p>It has been found by Sir William Herschel and others that the
definition of a telescope is often improved by stopping off a part of
the central area of the object-glass; but the advantage to be obtained
in this way is in no case great, and anything like a reduction of the
aperture to a narrow annulus is attended by a development of the
external luminous rings sufficient to outweigh any improvement
due to the diminished diameter of the central area.<a name="fa2g" id="fa2g" href="#ft2g"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>

<p>5. <i>Resolving Power of Telescopes.</i>&mdash;The efficiency of a telescope
is of course intimately connected with the size of the disk
by which it represents a mathematical point. In estimating
theoretically the resolving power on a double star we have to
consider the illumination of the field due to the superposition of
the two independent images. If the angular interval between the
components of a double star were equal to twice that expressed
in equation (15) above, the central disks of the diffraction patterns
would be just in contact. Under these conditions there is no
doubt that the star would appear to be fairly resolved, since the
brightness of its external ring system is too small to produce any
material confusion, unless indeed the components are of very
unequal magnitude. The diminution of the star disks with
increasing aperture was observed by Sir William Herschel, and in
1823 Fraunhofer formulated the law of inverse proportionality.
In investigations extending over a long series of years, the
advantage of a large aperture in separating the components of
close double stars was fully examined by W. R. Dawes.</p>

<p>The resolving power of telescopes was investigated also by
J. B. L. Foucault, who employed a scale of equal bright and dark
alternate parts; it was found to be proportional to the aperture
and independent of the focal length. In telescopes of the best
construction and of moderate aperture the performance is not
sensibly prejudiced by outstanding aberration, and the limit
imposed by the finiteness of the waves of light is practically
reached. M. E. Verdet has compared Foucault&rsquo;s results with
theory, and has drawn the conclusion that the radius of the
visible part of the image of a luminous point was equal to half the
radius of the first dark ring.</p>

<p>The application, unaccountably long delayed, of this principle
to the microscope by H. L. F. Helmholtz in 1871 is the foundation
of the important doctrine of the <i>microscopic limit</i>. It is true that
in 1823 Fraunhofer, inspired by his observations upon gratings,
had very nearly hit the mark.<a name="fa3g" id="fa3g" href="#ft3g"><span class="sp">3</span></a> And a little before Helmholtz,
E. Abbe published a somewhat more complete investigation, also
founded upon the phenomena presented by gratings. But
although the argument from gratings is instructive and convenient
in some respects, its use has tended to obscure the essential unity
of the principle of the limit of resolution whether applied to
telescopes or microscopes.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="float: right; width: 340px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figright1"><img style="width:288px; height:145px" src="images/img243.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption sc">Fig. 4.</td></tr></table>

<p>In fig. 4, AB represents the axis of an optical instrument (telescope
or microscope), A being a point of the object and B a point
of the image. By the operation of the object-glass LL&prime; all the rays
issuing from A arrive in the same phase at B. Thus if A be self-luminous,
the illumination is
a maximum at B, where all
the secondary waves agree in
phase. B is in fact the centre
of the diffraction disk which
constitutes the image of A.
At neighbouring points the
illumination is less, in consequence
of the discrepancies of
phase which there enter. In
like manner if we take a neighbouring
point P, also self-luminous,
in the plane of the object, the waves which issue from
it will arrive at B with phases no longer absolutely concordant,
and the discrepancy of phase will increase as the interval AP
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>244</span>
increases. When the interval is very small the discrepancy,
though mathematically existent, produces no practical effect; and
the illumination at B due to P is as important as that due to A,
the intensities of the two luminous sources being supposed equal.
Under these conditions it is clear that A and P are not separated in
the image. The question is to what amount must the distance AP
be increased in order that the difference of situation may make itself
felt in the image. This is necessarily a question of degree; but it
does not require detailed calculations in order to show that the
discrepancy first becomes conspicuous when the phases corresponding
to the various secondary waves which travel from P to B range over
a complete period. The illumination at B due to P then becomes
comparatively small, indeed for some forms of aperture evanescent.
The extreme discrepancy is that between the waves which travel
through the outermost parts of the object-glass at L and L&prime;; so that
if we adopt the above standard of resolution, the question is where
must P be situated in order that the relative retardation of the rays
PL and PL&rsquo; may on their arrival at B amount to a wave-length (&lambda;).
In virtue of the general law that the reduced optical path is stationary
in value, this retardation may be calculated without allowance for
the different paths pursued on the farther side of L, L&prime;, so that the
value is simply PL &minus; PL&prime;. Now since AP is very small, AL&prime; &minus; PL&prime; =
AP sin &alpha;, where &alpha; is the angular semi-aperture L&prime;AB. In like manner
PL &minus; AL has the same value, so that</p>

<p class="center">PL &minus; PL&prime; = 2AP sin &alpha;.</p>

<p>According to the standard adopted, the condition of resolution is
therefore that AP, or &epsilon;, should exceed ½&lambda;/sin &alpha;. If &epsilon; be less than this,
the images overlap too much; while if &epsilon; greatly exceed the above
value the images become unnecessarily separated.</p>

<p>In the above argument the whole space between the object and
the lens is supposed to be occupied by matter of one refractive index,
and &lambda; represents the wave-length <i>in this medium</i> of the kind of light
employed. If the restriction as to uniformity be violated, what we
have ultimately to deal with is the wave-length in the medium
immediately surrounding the object.</p>

<p>Calling the refractive index &mu;, we have as the critical value of &epsilon;,</p>

<p class="center">&epsilon; = ½&lambda;<span class="su">0</span> /&mu; sin &alpha;, &emsp; &emsp; (1),</p>

<p class="noind">&lambda;<span class="su">0</span> being the wave-length <i>in vacuo</i>. The denominator &mu; sin &alpha; is the
quantity well known (after Abbe) as the &ldquo;numerical aperture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The extreme value possible for &alpha; is a right angle, so that for the
microscopic limit we have</p>

<p class="center">&epsilon; = ½&lambda;<span class="su">0</span>/&mu; &emsp; &emsp; (2).</p>

<p class="noind">The limit can be depressed only by a diminution in &lambda;<span class="su">0</span>, such as
photography makes possible, or by an increase in &mu;, the refractive
index of the medium in which the object is situated.</p>

<p>The statement of the law of resolving power has been made in a
form appropriate to the microscope, but it admits also of immediate
application to the telescope. If 2R be the diameter of the object-glass
and D the distance of the object, the angle subtended by AP is
&epsilon;/D, and the angular resolving power is given by</p>

<p class="center">&lambda;/2D sin &alpha; = &lambda;/2R &emsp; &emsp; (3).</p>

<p class="noind">This method of derivation (substantially due to Helmholtz) makes
it obvious that there is no essential difference of principle between
the two cases, although the results are conveniently stated in different
forms. In the case of the telescope we have to deal with a linear
measure of aperture and an angular limit of resolution, whereas in
the case of the microscope the limit of resolution is linear, and it is
expressed in terms of angular aperture.</p>

<p>It must be understood that the above argument distinctly assumes
that the different parts of the object are self-luminous, or at least
that the light proceeding from the various points is without phase
relations. As has been emphasized by G. J. Stoney, the restriction
is often, perhaps usually, violated in the microscope. A different
treatment is then necessary, and for some of the problems which
arise under this head the method of Abbe is convenient.</p>

<p>The importance of the general conclusions above formulated, as
imposing a limit upon our powers of direct observation, can hardly
be overestimated; but there has been in some quarters a tendency
to ascribe to it a more precise character than it can bear, or even to
mistake its meaning altogether. A few words of further explanation
may therefore be desirable. The first point to be emphasized is that
nothing whatever is said as to the smallness of a single object that
may be made visible. The eye, unaided or armed with a telescope,
is able to see, as points of light, stars subtending no sensible angle.
The visibility of a star is a question of brightness simply, and has
nothing to do with resolving power. The latter element enters only
when it is a question of recognizing the duplicity of a double star,
or of distinguishing detail upon the surface of a planet. So in the
microscope there is nothing except lack of light to hinder the visibility
of an object however small. But if its dimensions be much
less than the half wave-length, it can only be seen as a whole, and its
parts cannot be distinctly separated, although in cases near the border
line some inference may be possible, founded upon experience of what
appearances are presented in various cases. Interesting observations
upon particles, <i>ultra-microscopic</i> in the above sense, have been
recorded by H. F. W. Siedentopf and R. A. Zsigmondy (<i>Drude&rsquo;s Ann.</i>,
1903, 10, p. 1).</p>

<p>In a somewhat similar way a dark linear interruption in a bright
ground may be visible, although its actual width is much inferior
to the half wave-length. In illustration of this fact a simple experiment
may be mentioned. In front of the naked eye was held a piece
of copper foil perforated by a fine needle hole. Observed through
this the structure of some wire gauze just disappeared at a distance
from the eye equal to 17 in., the gauze containing 46 meshes to
the inch. On the other hand, a single wire 0.034 in. in diameter
remained fairly visible up to a distance of 20 ft. The ratio between
the limiting angles subtended by the periodic structure of the gauze
and the diameter of the wire was (.022/.034) × (240/17) = 9.1. For
further information upon this subject reference may be made to
<i>Phil. Mag.</i>, 1896, 42, p. 167; <i>Journ. R. Micr. Soc.</i>, 1903, p. 447.</p>

<p>6. <i>Coronas or Glories.</i>&mdash;The results of the theory of the diffraction
patterns due to circular apertures admit of an interesting
application to <i>coronas</i>, such as are often seen encircling the sun
and moon. They are due to the interposition of small spherules
of water, which act the part of diffracting obstacles. In order to
the formation of a well-defined corona it is essential that the
particles be exclusively, or preponderatingly, of one size.</p>

<p>If the origin of light be treated as infinitely small, and be seen
in focus, whether with the naked eye or with the aid of a telescope,
the whole of the light in the absence of obstacles would be concentrated
in the immediate neighbourhood of the focus. At other
parts of the field the effect is the same, in accordance with the
principle known as Babinet&rsquo;s, whether the imaginary screen in front
of the object-glass is generally transparent but studded with a number
of opaque circular disks, or is generally opaque but perforated with
corresponding apertures. Since at these points the resultant due to
the whole aperture is zero, any two portions into which the whole
may be divided must give equal and opposite resultants. Consider
now the light diffracted in a direction many times more oblique than
any with which we should be concerned, were the whole aperture
uninterrupted, and take first the effect of a single small aperture.
The light in the proposed direction is that determined by the size of
the small aperture in accordance with the laws already investigated,
and its phase depends upon the position of the aperture. If we take
a direction such that the light (of given wave-length) from a single
aperture vanishes, the evanescence continues even when the whole
series of apertures is brought into contemplation. Hence, whatever
else may happen, there must be a system of dark rings formed,
the same as from a single small aperture. In directions other than
these it is a more delicate question how the partial effects should be
compounded. If we make the extreme suppositions of an infinitely
small source and absolutely homogeneous light, there is no escape
from the conclusion that the light in a definite direction is arbitrary,
that is, dependent upon the chance distribution of apertures. If,
however, as in practice, the light be heterogeneous, the source of
finite area, the obstacles in motion, and the discrimination of different
directions imperfect, we are concerned merely with the mean brightness
found by varying the arbitrary phase-relations, and this is
obtained by simply multiplying the brightness due to a single
aperture by the number of apertures (n) (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Interference of
Light</a></span>, § 4). The diffraction pattern is therefore that due to a single
aperture, merely brightened n times.</p>

<p>In his experiments upon this subject Fraunhofer employed plates
of glass dusted over with lycopodium, or studded with small metallic
disks of uniform size; and he found that the diameters of the rings
were proportional to the length of the waves and inversely as the
diameter of the disks.</p>

<p>In another respect the observations of Fraunhofer appear at
first sight to be in disaccord with theory; for his measures of the
diameters of the red rings, visible when white light was employed,
correspond with the law applicable to dark rings, and not to the
different law applicable to the luminous maxima. Verdet has,
however, pointed out that the observation in this form is essentially
different from that in which homogeneous red light is employed,
and that the position of the red rings would correspond to the
<i>absence</i> of blue-green light rather than to the greatest abundance of
red light. Verdet&rsquo;s own observations, conducted with great care,
fully confirm this view, and exhibit a complete agreement with
theory.</p>

<p>By measurements of coronas it is possible to infer the size of the
particles to which they are due, an application of considerable
interest in the case of natural coronas&mdash;the general rule being the
larger the corona the smaller the water spherules. Young employed
this method not only to determine the diameters of cloud particles
(<i>e.g.</i> <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1000</span> in.), but also those of fibrous material, for which the
theory is analogous. His instrument was called the <i>eriometer</i>
(see &ldquo;Chromatics,&rdquo; vol. iii. of supp. to <i>Ency. Brit.</i>, 1817).</p>

<p>7. <i>Influence of Aberration. Optical Power of Instruments.</i>&mdash;Our
investigations and estimates of resolving power have thus
far proceeded upon the supposition that there are no optical
imperfections, whether of the nature of a regular aberration or
dependent upon irregularities of material and workmanship. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>245</span>
practice there will always be a certain aberration or error of phase,
which we may also regard as the deviation of the actual wave-surface
from its intended position. In general, we may say that
aberration is unimportant when it nowhere (or at any rate over a
relatively small area only) exceeds a small fraction of the wave-length
(&lambda;). Thus in estimating the intensity at a focal point,
where, in the absence of aberration, all the secondary waves would
have exactly the same phase, we see that an aberration nowhere
exceeding ¼&lambda; can have but little effect.</p>

<p>The only case in which the influence of small aberration upon
the entire image has been calculated (<i>Phil. Mag.</i>, 1879) is that of a
rectangular aperture, traversed by a cylindrical wave with aberration
equal to cx³. The aberration is here unsymmetrical, the wave being
in advance of its proper place in one half of the aperture, but behind
in the other half. No terms in x or x² need be considered. The
first would correspond to a general turning of the beam; and the
second would imply imperfect focusing of the central parts. The
effect of aberration may be considered in two ways. We may
suppose the aperture (a) constant, and inquire into the operation
of an increasing aberration; or we may take a given value of c (<i>i.e.</i>
a given wave-surface) and examine the effect of a varying aperture.
The results in the second case show that an increase of aperture
up to that corresponding to an extreme aberration of half a period
has no ill effect upon the central band (§ 3), but it increases unduly
the intensity of one of the neighbouring lateral bands; and the
practical conclusion is that the best results will be obtained from an
aperture giving an extreme aberration of from a quarter to half a
period, and that with an increased aperture aberration is not so
much a direct cause of deterioration as an obstacle to the attainment
of that improved definition which should accompany the increase
of aperture.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, we suppose the aperture given, we find
that aberration begins to be distinctly mischievous when it amounts
to about a quarter period, <i>i.e.</i> when the wave-surface deviates at
each end by a quarter wave-length from the true plane.</p>

<p>As an application of this result, let us investigate what amount
of temperature disturbance in the tube of a telescope may be expected
to impair definition. According to J. B. Biot and F. J. D.
Arago, the index &mu; for air at t° C. and at atmospheric pressure is given
by</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr><td rowspan="2">&mu; &minus; 1 =</td> <td>.00029</td> <td rowspan="2">.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="denom">1 + .0037 t</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">If we take 0° C. as standard temperature,</p>

<p class="center"> &delta;&mu; = -1.1 × 10<span class="sp">-6</span>.</p>

<p class="noind">Thus, on the supposition that the irregularity of temperature t
extends through a length l, and produces an acceleration of a quarter
of a wave-length,</p>

<p class="center">¼&lambda; = 1.1 lt × 10<span class="sp">-6</span>;</p>

<p class="noind">or, if we take &lambda; = 5.3 × 10<span class="sp">-5</span>,</p>

<p class="center">lt = 12,</p>

<p class="noind">the unit of length being the centimetre.</p>

<p>We may infer that, in the case of a telescope tube 12 cm. long,
a stratum of air heated 1° C. lying along the top of the tube, and
occupying a moderate fraction of the whole volume, would produce
a not insensible effect. If the change of temperature progressed
uniformly from one side to the other, the result would be a lateral
displacement of the image without loss of definition; but in general
both effects would be observable. In longer tubes a similar disturbance
would be caused by a proportionally less difference of
temperature. S. P. Langley has proposed to obviate such ill-effects
by stirring the air included within a telescope tube. It has long been
known that the definition of a carbon bisulphide prism may be much
improved by a vigorous shaking.</p>

<p>We will now consider the application of the principle to the
formation of images, unassisted by reflection or refraction (<i>Phil. Mag.</i>,
1881). The function of a lens in forming an image is to compensate
by its variable thickness the differences of phase which would otherwise
exist between secondary waves arriving at the focal point from
various parts of the aperture. If we suppose the diameter of the
lens to be given (2R), and its focal length &fnof; gradually to increase, the
original differences of phase at the image of an infinitely distant
luminous point diminish without limit. When &fnof; attains a certain
value, say &fnof;<span class="su">1</span>, the extreme error of phase to be compensated falls
to ¼&lambda;. But, as we have seen, such an error of phase causes no sensible
deterioration in the definition; so that from this point onwards
the lens is useless, as only improving an image already sensibly as
perfect as the aperture admits of. Throughout the operation of
increasing the focal length, the resolving power of the instrument,
which depends only upon the aperture, remains unchanged; and
we thus arrive at the rather startling conclusion that a telescope
of any degree of resolving power might be constructed without an
object-glass, if only there were no limit to the admissible focal length.
This last proviso, however, as we shall see, takes away almost all
practical importance from the proposition.</p>

<p>To get an idea of the magnitudes of the quantities involved, let us
take the case of an aperture of <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">5</span> in., about that of the pupil of the
eye. The distance &fnof;<span class="su">1</span>, which the actual focal length must exceed, is
given by</p>

<p class="center">&radic; (&fnof;<span class="su">1</span>² + R²) &minus; &fnof;<span class="su">1</span>  = ¼&lambda;;</p>

<p class="noind">so that</p>

<p class="center">&fnof;<span class="su">1</span>  = 2R²/&lambda; &emsp; &emsp; (1).</p>

<p class="noind">Thus, if &lambda; = <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">40000</span>, R = <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">10</span>, we find</p>

<p class="center">&fnof;<span class="su">1</span> = 800 inches.</p>

<p>The image of the sun thrown upon a screen at a distance exceeding
66 ft., through a hole <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">5</span> in. in diameter, is therefore at least as well
defined as that seen direct.</p>

<p>As the minimum focal length increases with the square of the
aperture, a quite impracticable distance would be required to rival
the resolving power of a modern telescope. Even for an aperture of
4 in., &fnof;<span class="su">1</span> would have to be 5 miles.</p>

<p>A similar argument may be applied to find at what point an
achromatic lens becomes sensibly superior to a single one. The
question is whether, when the adjustment of focus is correct for the
central rays of the spectrum, the error of phase for the most extreme
rays (which it is necessary to consider) amounts to a quarter of a
wave-length. If not, the substitution of an achromatic lens will be
of no advantage. Calculation shows that, if the aperture be <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">5</span> in.,
an achromatic lens has no sensible advantage if the focal length
be greater than about 11 in. If we suppose the focal length to be
66 ft., a single lens is practically perfect up to an aperture of 1.7 in.</p>

<p>Another obvious inference from the necessary imperfection of
optical images is the uselessness of attempting anything like an
absolute destruction of spherical aberration. An admissible error
of phase of ¼&lambda; will correspond to an error of <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span>&lambda; in a reflecting and ½&lambda;
in a (glass) refracting surface, the incidence in both cases being
perpendicular. If we inquire what is the greatest admissible longitudinal
aberration (&delta;&fnof;) in an object-glass according to the above
rule, we find</p>

<p class="center">&delta;&fnof; = &lambda;&alpha;<span class="sp">-2</span> &emsp; &emsp; (2),</p>

<p class="noind">&alpha; being the angular semi-aperture.</p>

<p>In the case of a single lens of glass with the most favourable curvatures,
&delta;&fnof; is about equal to &alpha;²&fnof;, so that &alpha;<span class="sp">4</span> must not exceed &lambda;/&fnof;. For
a lens of 3 ft. focus this condition is satisfied if the aperture does
not exceed 2 in.</p>

<p>When parallel rays fall directly upon a spherical mirror the
longitudinal aberration is only about one-eighth as great as for the
most favourably shaped single lens of equal focal length and aperture.
Hence a spherical mirror of 3 ft. focus might have an
aperture of 2½ in., and the image would not suffer materially from
aberration.</p>

<p>On the same principle we may estimate the least visible displacement
of the eye-piece of a telescope focused upon a distant object,
a question of interest in connexion with range-finders. It appears
(<i>Phil. Mag.</i>, 1885, 20, p. 354) that a displacement &delta;f from the true focus
will not sensibly impair definition, provided</p>

<p class="center">&delta;&fnof; &lt; &fnof;²&lambda;/R² &emsp; &emsp; (3),</p>

<p class="noind">2R being the diameter of aperture. The linear accuracy required
is thus a function of the <i>ratio</i> of aperture to focal length. The
formula agrees well with experiment.</p>

<p>The principle gives an instantaneous solution of the question of
the ultimate optical efficiency in the method of &ldquo;mirror-reading,&rdquo;
as commonly practised in various physical observations. A rotation
by which one edge of the mirror advances ¼&lambda; (while the other edge
retreats to a like amount) introduces a phase-discrepancy of a whole
period where before the rotation there was complete agreement. A
rotation of this amount should therefore be easily visible, but the
limits of resolving power are being approached; and the conclusion
is independent of the focal length of the mirror, and of the employment
of a telescope, provided of course that the reflected image is
seen in focus, and that the full width of the mirror is utilized.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="float: right; width: 270px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figright1"><img style="width:220px; height:101px" src="images/img245.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption sc">Fig. 5.</td></tr></table>

<p>A comparison with the method of a material pointer, attached to
the parts whose rotation is under observation, and viewed through
a microscope, is of interest. The
limiting efficiency of the microscope
is attained when the angular aperture
amounts to 180°; and it is evident
that a lateral displacement of the point
under observation through ½&lambda; entails
(at the old image) a phase-discrepancy
of a whole period, one extreme ray
being accelerated and the other retarded
by half that amount. We may infer that the limits of
efficiency in the two methods are the same when the length of the
pointer is equal to the width of the mirror.</p>

<p>We have seen that in perpendicular reflection a surface error not
exceeding <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span>&lambda; may be admissible. In the case of oblique reflection
at an angle &phi;, the error of retardation due to an elevation BD (fig. 5)
is</p>

<p class="center">
QQ&prime; &minus; QS = BD sec &phi;(1 &minus; cos SQQ&prime;) = BD sec &phi; (1 + cos 2&phi;) = 2BD cos &phi;;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>246</span></p>

<p class="noind">from which it follows that an error of given magnitude in the figure
of a surface is less important in oblique than in perpendicular
reflection. It must, however, be borne in mind that errors can
sometimes be compensated by altering adjustments. If a surface
intended to be flat is affected with a slight general curvature, a
remedy may be found in an alteration of focus, and the remedy is
the less complete as the reflection is more oblique.</p>

<p>The formula expressing the optical power of prismatic spectroscopes
may readily be investigated upon the principles of the wave
theory. Let A<span class="su">0</span>B<span class="su">0</span> be a plane wave-surface of the light before it falls
upon the prisms, AB the corresponding wave-surface for a particular
part of the spectrum after the light has passed the prisms, or after it
has passed the eye-piece of the observing telescope. The path of a
ray from the wave-surface A<span class="su">0</span>B<span class="su">0</span> to A or B is determined by the condition
that the optical distance, &int; &mu; ds, is a minimum; and, as AB
is by supposition a wave-surface, this optical distance is the same
for both points. Thus</p>

<p class="center"><span class="f150">&int;</span> &mu; ds (for A) = <span class="f150">&int;</span> &mu; ds (for B) &emsp; &emsp; (4).</p>

<p class="noind">We have now to consider the behaviour of light belonging to a
neighbouring part of the spectrum. The path of a ray from the
wave-surface A<span class="su">0</span>B<span class="su">0</span> to the point A is changed; but in virtue of the
minimum property the change may be neglected in calculating the
optical distance, as it influences the result by quantities of the second
order only in the changes of refrangibility. Accordingly, the optical
distance from A<span class="su">0</span>B<span class="su">0</span> to A is represented by &int;(&mu; + &delta;&mu;)ds, the integration
being along the original path A<span class="su">0</span> ... A; and similarly the optical
distance between A<span class="su">0</span>B<span class="su">0</span> and B is represented by &int; (&mu; + &delta;&mu;)ds, the
integration being along B<span class="su">0</span> ... B. In virtue of (4) the difference
of the optical distances to A and B is</p>

<p class="center"><span class="f150">&int;</span> &delta;&mu; ds (along B<span class="su">0</span> ... B) &minus; <span class="f150">&int;</span> &delta;&mu; ds (along A<span class="su">0</span> ... A) &emsp; &emsp; (5).</p>

<p class="noind">The new wave-surface is formed in such a position that the optical
distance is constant; and therefore the <i>dispersion</i>, or the angle
through which the wave-surface is turned by the change of refrangibility,
is found simply by dividing (5) by the distance AB. If, as
in common flint-glass spectroscopes, there is only one dispersing
substance, &int; &delta;&mu; ds = &delta;&mu;·s, where s is simply the thickness traversed
by the ray. If t<span class="su">2</span> and t<span class="su">1</span> be the thicknesses traversed by the extreme
rays, and a denote the width of the emergent beam, the dispersion
&theta; is given by</p>

<p class="center">&theta; = &delta;&mu;(t<span class="su">2</span> &minus; t<span class="su">1</span>)/a,</p>

<p class="noind">or, if t<span class="su">1</span> be negligible,</p>

<p class="center">&theta; = &delta;&mu;t/a &emsp; &emsp; (6).</p>

<p class="noind">The condition of resolution of a double line whose components
subtend an angle &theta; is that &theta; must exceed &lambda;/a. Hence, in order
that a double line may be resolved whose components have indices
&mu; and &mu; + &delta;&mu;, it is necessary that t should exceed the value given
by the following equation:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">t = &lambda;/&delta;&mu; &emsp; &emsp; (7).</p>

<p>8. <i>Diffraction Gratings.</i>&mdash;Under the heading &ldquo;Colours of
Striated Surfaces,&rdquo; Thomas Young (<i>Phil. Trans.</i>, 1802) in his
usual summary fashion gave a general explanation of these
colours, including the law of sines, the striations being supposed
to be straight, parallel and equidistant. Later, in his article
&ldquo;Chromatics&rdquo; in the supplement to the 5th edition of this
encyclopaedia, he shows that the colours &ldquo;lose the mixed
character of periodical colours, and resemble much more the
ordinary prismatic spectrum, with intervals completely dark
interposed,&rdquo; and explains it by the consideration that any phase-difference
which may arise at neighbouring striae is multiplied in
proportion to the total number of striae.</p>

<p>The theory was further developed by A. J. Fresnel (1815), who
gave a formula equivalent to (5) below. But it is to J. von
Fraunhofer that we owe most of our knowledge upon this subject.
His recent discovery of the &ldquo;fixed lines&rdquo; allowed a precision of
observation previously impossible. He constructed gratings up
to 340 periods to the inch by straining fine wire over screws.
Subsequently he ruled gratings on a layer of gold-leaf attached to
glass, or on a layer of grease similarly supported, and again by
attacking the glass itself with a diamond point. The best gratings
were obtained by the last method, but a suitable diamond point
was hard to find, and to preserve. Observing through a telescope
with light perpendicularly incident, he showed that the position
of any ray was dependent only upon the grating interval, viz. the
distance from the centre of one wire or line to the centre of the
next, and not otherwise upon the thickness of the wire and the
magnitude of the interspace. In different gratings the lengths
of the spectra and their distances from the axis were inversely
proportional to the grating interval, while with a given grating
the distances of the various spectra from the axis were as 1, 2, 3,
&amp;c. To Fraunhofer we owe the first accurate measurements
of wave-lengths, and the method of separating the overlapping
spectra by a prism dispersing in the perpendicular direction.
He described also the complicated patterns seen when a point of
light is viewed through two superposed gratings, whose lines cross
one another perpendicularly or obliquely. The above observations
relate to transmitted light, but Fraunhofer extended his
inquiry to the light <i>reflected</i>. To eliminate the light returned
from the hinder surface of an engraved grating, he covered it with
a black varnish. It then appeared that under certain angles of
incidence parts of the resulting spectra were <i>completely polarized</i>.
These remarkable researches of Fraunhofer, carried out in the
years 1817-1823, are republished in his <i>Collected Writings</i>
(Munich, 1888).</p>

<p>The principle underlying the action of gratings is identical with
that discussed in § 2, and exemplified in J. L. Soret&rsquo;s &ldquo;zone plates.&rdquo;
The alternate Fresnel&rsquo;s zones are blocked out or otherwise modified;
in this way the original compensation is upset and a revival of light
occurs in unusual directions. If the source be a point or a line, and
a collimating lens be used, the incident waves may be regarded as
plane. If, further, on leaving the grating the light be received by a
focusing lens, <i>e.g.</i> the object-glass of a telescope, the Fresnel&rsquo;s zones
are reduced to parallel and equidistant straight strips, which at
certain angles coincide with the ruling. The directions of the lateral
spectra are such that the passage from one element of the grating
to the corresponding point of the next implies a retardation of
an integral number of wave-lengths. If the grating be composed
of alternate transparent and opaque parts, the question may be
treated by means of the general integrals (§ 3) by merely limiting
the integration to the transparent parts of the aperture. For an
investigation upon these lines the reader is referred to Airy&rsquo;s
<i>Tracts</i>, to Verdet&rsquo;s <i>Leçons</i>, or to R. W. Wood&rsquo;s <i>Physical Optics</i>. If,
however, we assume the theory of a simple rectangular aperture
(§ 3); the results of the ruling can be inferred by elementary methods,
which are perhaps more instructive.</p>

<p>Apart from the ruling, we know that the image of a mathematical
line will be a series of narrow bands, of which the central one is
by far the brightest. At the middle of this band there is complete
agreement of phase among the secondary waves. The dark lines
which separate the bands are the places at which the phases of the
secondary wave range over an integral number of periods. If now
we suppose the aperture AB to be covered by a great number of
opaque strips or bars of width d, separated by transparent intervals
of width a, the condition of things in the directions just spoken of
is not materially changed. At the central point there is still complete
agreement of phase; but the amplitude is diminished in the ratio of
a : a + d. In another direction, making a small angle with the last,
such that the projection of AB upon it amounts to a few wave-lengths,
it is easy to see that the mode of interference is the same as
if there were no ruling. For example, when the direction is such that
the projection of AB upon it amounts to one wave-length, the
elementary components neutralize one another, because their phases
are distributed symmetrically, though discontinuously, round the
entire period. The only effect of the ruling is to diminish the
amplitude in the ratio a : a + d; and, except for the difference in
illumination, the appearance of a line of light is the same as if the
aperture were perfectly free.</p>

<p>The lateral (spectral) images occur in such directions that the
projection of the element (a + d) of the grating upon them is an exact
multiple of &lambda;. The effect of each of the n elements of the grating
is then the same; and, unless this vanishes on account of a particular
adjustment of the ratio a : d, the resultant amplitude becomes comparatively
very great. These directions, in which the retardation
between A and B is exactly mn&lambda;, may be called the principal directions.
On either side of any one of them the illumination is distributed
according to the same law as for the central image (m = 0),
vanishing, for example, when the retardation amounts to (mn ± 1)&lambda;.
In considering the relative brightnesses of the different spectra, it
is therefore sufficient to attend merely to the principal directions,
provided that the whole deviation be not so great that its cosine
differs considerably from unity.</p>

<p>We have now to consider the amplitude due to a single element,
which we may conveniently regard as composed of a transparent
part a bounded by two opaque parts of width ½d. The phase of
the resultant effect is by symmetry that of the component which
comes from the middle of a. The fact that the other components
have phases differing from this by amounts ranging between
± am&pi;/(a + d) causes the resultant amplitude to be less than for
the central image (where there is complete phase agreement).

<p>According to a general principle formulated by J. Babinet, the
brightness of a lateral spectrum is not affected by an interchange
of the transparent and opaque parts of the grating. The vibrations
corresponding to the two parts are precisely antagonistic, since if
both were operative the resultant would be zero. So far as the
application to gratings is concerned, the same conclusion may be
derived from (2).</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="float: left; width: 190px;" summary="Illustration">

<p>From the value of B<span class="su">m</span> : B<span class="su">0</span> we see that no lateral spectrum can
surpass the central image in brightness; but this result depends upon
the hypothesis that the ruling acts by opacity, which is generally
very far from being the case in practice. In an engraved glass
grating there is no opaque material present by which light could be
absorbed, and the effect depends upon a difference of retardation in
passing the alternate parts. It is possible to prepare gratings which
give a lateral spectrum brighter than the central image, and the explanation
is easy. For if the alternate parts were equal and alike
transparent, but so constituted as to give a relative retardation of
½&lambda;, it is evident that the central image would be entirely extinguished,
while the first spectrum would be four times as bright as if the
alternate parts were opaque. If it were possible to introduce at
every part of the aperture of the grating an arbitrary retardation,
all the light might be concentrated in any desired spectrum. By
supposing the retardation to vary uniformly and continuously we
fall upon the case of an ordinary prism: but there
is then no diffraction spectrum in the usual sense.
To obtain such it would be necessary that the
retardation should gradually alter by a wave-length
in passing over any element of the grating,
and then fall back to its previous value, thus
springing suddenly over a wave-length (<i>Phil.
Mag.</i>, 1874, 47, p. 193). It is not likely that such
a result will ever be fully attained in practice; but
the case is worth stating, in order to show that
there is no theoretical limit to the concentration
of light of assigned wave-length in one spectrum,
and as illustrating the frequently observed unsymmetrical
character of the spectra on the two sides of the central
image.<a name="fa4g" id="fa4g" href="#ft4g"><span class="sp">4</span></a></p>

<p>We have hitherto supposed that the light is incident perpendicularly
upon the grating; but the theory is easily extended. If
the incident rays make an angle &theta; with the normal (fig. 6), and the
diffracted rays make an angle &phi; (upon the same side), the relative
retardation from each element of width (a + d) to the next is
(a + d) (sin&theta; + sin&phi;); and this is the quantity which is to be equated
to m&lambda;. Thus</p>

<p class="center">sin&theta; + sin&phi; = 2sin ½(&theta; + &phi;) cos ½ (&theta; &minus; &phi;) = m&lambda;/(a + d) &emsp; &emsp; (5).</p>

<p>The &ldquo;deviation&rdquo; is (&theta; + &phi;), and is therefore a minimum when
&theta; = &phi;, <i>i.e.</i> when the grating is so situated that the angles of incidence
and diffraction are equal.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="float: right; width: 220px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figright1"><img style="width:165px; height:102px" src="images/img247b.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption sc">Fig. 7.</td></tr></table>

<p>In the case of a reflection grating the same method applies. If
&theta; and &phi; denote the angles with the normal made by the incident
and diffracted rays, the formula (5) still holds,
and, if the deviation be reckoned from the
direction of the regularly reflected rays, it is
expressed as before by (&theta; + &phi;), and is a minimum
when &theta; = &phi;, that is, when the diffracted
rays return upon the course of the incident
rays.</p>

<p>In either case (as also with a prism) the
position of minimum deviation leaves the
width of the beam unaltered, <i>i.e.</i> neither magnifies nor diminishes the
angular width of the object under view.</p>

<p>From (5) we see that, when the light falls perpendicularly upon
a grating (&theta; = 0), there is no spectrum formed (the image corresponding
to m = 0 not being counted as a spectrum), if the grating
interval &sigma; or (a + d) is less than &lambda;. Under these circumstances,
if the material of the grating be completely transparent, the whole
of the light must appear in the direct image, and the ruling is not
perceptible. From the absence of spectra Fraunhofer argued that
there must be a microscopic limit represented by &lambda;; and the inference
is plausible, to say the least (<i>Phil. Mag.</i>, 1886). Fraunhofer
should, however, have fixed the microscopic limit at ½&lambda;, as appears
from (5), when we suppose &theta; = ½&pi;, &phi; = ½&pi;.</p>

<p>We will now consider the important subject of the resolving
power of gratings, as dependent upon the
number of lines (n) and the order of the spectrum
observed (m). Let BP (fig. 8) be the
direction of the principal maximum (middle
of central band) for the wave-length &lambda; in the
m<span class="sp">th</span> spectrum. Then the relative retardation
of the extreme rays (corresponding to the
edges A, B of the grating) is mn&lambda;. If BQ
be the direction for the first minimum (the
darkness between the central and first lateral
band), the relative retardation of the extreme rays is (mn + 1)&lambda;.
Suppose now that &lambda; + &delta;&lambda; is the wave-length for which BQ gives the
principal maximum, then</p>

<p class="center">(mn + 1)&lambda; = mn(&lambda; + &delta;&lambda;);</p>

<p class="noind">whence</p>

<p class="center">&delta;&lambda;/&lambda; = 1/mn &emsp; &emsp; (6).</p>

<p class="noind">According to our former standard, this gives the smallest difference
of wave-lengths in a double line which can be just resolved; and
we conclude that the resolving power of a grating depends only
upon the total number of lines, and upon the order of the spectrum,
without regard to any other considerations. It is here of course
assumed that the n lines are really utilized.</p>

<p>In the case of the D lines the value of &delta;&lambda;/&lambda; is about 1/1000; so
that to resolve this double line in the first spectrum requires 1000
lines, in the second spectrum 500, and so on.</p>

<p>It is especially to be noticed that the resolving power does not
depend directly upon the closeness of the ruling. Let us take the
case of a grating 1 in. broad, and containing 1000 lines, and consider
the effect of interpolating an additional 1000 lines, so as to bisect
the former intervals. There will be destruction by interference of
the first, third and odd spectra generally; while the advantage
gained in the spectra of even order is not in dispersion, nor in
resolving power, but simply in brilliancy, which is increased four
times. If we now suppose half the grating cut away, so as to leave
1000 lines in half an inch, the dispersion will not be altered, while the
brightness and resolving power are halved.</p>

<p>There is clearly no theoretical limit to the resolving power of
gratings, even in spectra of given order. But it is possible that,
as suggested by Rowland,<a name="fa5g" id="fa5g" href="#ft5g"><span class="sp">5</span></a> the structure of natural spectra may
be too coarse to give opportunity for resolving powers much higher
than those now in use. However this may be, it would always
be possible, with the aid of a grating of given resolving power, to
construct artificially from white light mixtures of slightly different
wave-length whose resolution or otherwise would discriminate
between powers inferior and superior to the given one.<a name="fa6g" id="fa6g" href="#ft6g"><span class="sp">6</span></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>248</span></p>

<p>If we define as the &ldquo;dispersion&rdquo; in a particular part of the
spectrum the ratio of the angular interval d&theta; to the corresponding
increment of wave-length d&lambda;, we may express it by a very simple
formula. For the alteration of wave-length entails, at the two
limits of a diffracted wave-front, a relative retardation equal to
mnd&lambda;. Hence, if a be the width of the diffracted beam, and d&theta; the
angle through which the wave-front is turned,</p>

<p class="center">ad&theta; = mn d&lambda;,</p>

<p class="noind">or</p>

<p class="center">dispersion = mn/a &emsp; &emsp; (7).</p>

<p>The resolving power and the width of the emergent beam fix
the optical character of the instrument. The latter element must
eventually be decreased until less than the diameter of the pupil
of the eye. Hence a wide beam demands treatment with further
apparatus (usually a telescope) of high magnifying power.</p>

<p>In the above discussion it has been supposed that the ruling is
accurate, and we have seen that by increase of m a high resolving
power is attainable with a moderate number of lines. But this
procedure (apart from the question of illumination) is open to the
objection that it makes excessive demands upon accuracy. According
to the principle already laid down it can make but little difference
in the principal direction corresponding to the first spectrum,
provided each line lie within a quarter of an interval (a + d) from its
theoretical position. But, to obtain an equally good result in the
m<span class="sp">th</span> spectrum, the error must be less than 1/m of the above amount.<a name="fa7g" id="fa7g" href="#ft7g"><span class="sp">7</span></a></p>

<p>There are certain errors of a systematic character which demand
special consideration. The spacing is usually effected by means of
a screw, to each revolution of which corresponds a large number
(<i>e.g.</i> one hundred) of lines. In this way it may happen that although
there is almost perfect periodicity with each revolution of the screw
after (say) 100 lines, yet the 100 lines themselves are not equally
spaced. The &ldquo;ghosts&rdquo; thus arising were first described by G. H.
Quincke (<i>Pogg. Ann.</i>, 1872, 146, p. 1), and have been elaborately
investigated by C. S. Peirce (<i>Ann. Journ. Math.</i>, 1879, 2, p. 330), both
theoretically and experimentally. The general nature of the effects
to be expected in such a case may be made clear by means of an illustration
already employed for another purpose. Suppose two similar
and accurately ruled transparent gratings to be superposed in such
a manner that the lines are parallel. If the one set of lines exactly
bisect the intervals between the others, the grating interval is
practically halved, and the previously existing spectra of odd order
vanish. But a very slight relative displacement will cause the
apparition of the odd spectra. In this case there is approximate
periodicity in the half interval, but complete periodicity only after
the whole interval. The advantage of approximate bisection lies
in the superior brilliancy of the surviving spectra; but in any case
the compound grating may be considered to be perfect in the
longer interval, and the definition is as good as if the bisection were
accurate.</p>

<p>The effect of a gradual increase in the interval (fig. 9) as we
pass across the grating has been investigated by M. A. Cornu
(<i>C.R.</i>, 1875, 80, p. 655), who thus explains an anomaly observed by
E. E. N. Mascart. The latter found that certain gratings exercised
a converging power upon the spectra formed upon one side, and a
corresponding diverging power upon the spectra on the other side.
Let us suppose that the light is incident perpendicularly, and that
the grating interval increases from the centre towards that edge
which lies nearest to the spectrum under observation, and decreases
towards the hinder edge. It is evident that the waves from <i>both</i>
halves of the
grating are accelerated
in an
increasing degree,
as we pass from
the centre outwards,
as compared
with the
phase they would possess were the central value of the grating
interval maintained throughout. The irregularity of spacing has
thus the effect of a convex lens, which accelerates the marginal
relatively to the central rays. On the other side the effect is
reversed. This kind of irregularity may clearly be present in a
degree surpassing the usual limits, without loss of definition, when
the telescope is focused so as to secure the best effect.</p>

<p>It may be worth while to examine further the other variations
from correct ruling which correspond to the various terms expressing
the deviation of the wave-surface from a perfect plane. If x and y
be co-ordinates in the plane of the wave-surface, the axis of y being
parallel to the lines of the grating, and the origin corresponding
to the centre of the beam, we may take as an approximate equation
to the wave-surface</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr><td rowspan="2">z =</td> <td>x²</td>
<td rowspan="2">+ Bxy +</td> <td>y²</td>

<tr><td class="denom">2&rho;</td> <td class="denom">2&rho;&prime;</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">and, as we have just seen, the term in x² corresponds to a linear
error in the spacing. In like manner, the term in y² corresponds
to a general <i>curvature</i> of the lines (fig. 10), and does not influence
the definition at the (primary) focus, although it may introduce
astigmatism.<a name="fa8g" id="fa8g" href="#ft8g"><span class="sp">8</span></a> If we suppose that everything is symmetrical on
the two sides of the primary plane y = 0, the coefficients B, &beta;, &delta;
vanish. In spite of any inequality between &rho; and &rho;&rsquo;, the definition
will be good to this order of approximation, provided &alpha; and &gamma; vanish.
The former measures the <i>thickness</i> of the primary focal line, and the
latter measures its <i>curvature</i>. The error of ruling giving rise to &alpha; is
one in which the intervals increase or decrease in <i>both</i> directions
from the centre outwards (fig. 11), and it may often be compensated
by a slight rotation in azimuth of the object-glass of the observing
telescope. The term in &gamma; corresponds to a <i>variation</i> of curvature
in crossing the grating (fig. 12).</p>

<p>When the plane zx is not a plane of symmetry, we have to consider
the terms in xy, x²y, and y³. The first of these corresponds to a deviation
from parallelism, causing the interval to alter gradually as we pass
<i>along</i> the lines (fig. 13). The error thus arising may be compensated
by a rotation of the object-glass about one of the diameters y = ± x.
The term in x²y corresponds to a deviation from parallelism in the
same direction on both sides of the central line (fig. 14); and that in
y³ would be caused by a curvature such that there is a point of
inflection at the middle of each line (fig. 15).</p>

<p>All the errors, except that depending on &alpha;, and especially those
depending on &gamma; and &delta;, can be diminished, without loss of resolving
power, by contracting the <i>vertical</i> aperture. A linear error in the
spacing, and a general curvature of the lines, are eliminated in the
ordinary use of a grating.</p>

<p>The explanation of the difference of focus upon the two sides as
due to unequal spacing was verified by Cornu upon gratings purposely
constructed with an increasing interval. He has also shown how to
rule a plane surface with lines so disposed that the grating shall of
itself give well-focused spectra.</p>

<p>A similar idea appears to have guided H. A. Rowland to his
brilliant invention of concave gratings, by
which spectra can be photographed without
any further optical appliance. In these
instruments the lines are ruled upon a
spherical surface of speculum metal, and
mark the intersections of the surface by a
system of parallel and equidistant planes,
of which the middle member passes through
the centre of the sphere. If we consider for
the present only the primary plane of symmetry,
the figure is reduced to two dimensions.
Let AP (fig. 16) represent the surface
of the grating, O being the centre of the
circle. Then, if Q be any radiant point and
Q&rsquo; its image (primary focus) in the spherical mirror AP, we have</p>

unsymmetrical aberration (depending upon a) vanishes.</p>

<p>This disposition is adopted in Rowland&prime;s instrument; only, in
addition to the central image formed at the angle &phi;&prime; = &phi;, there are
a series of spectra with various values of &phi;&rsquo;, but all disposed upon

the lines. This is the ordinary formula for a reflecting plane
grating, and it shows that the spectra are formed in the usual
directions. They are here focused (so far as the rays in the primary
plane are concerned) upon the circle OQ&prime;A, and the outstanding
aberration is of the fourth order.</p>

<p>In order that a large part of the field of view may be in focus at
once, it is desirable that the locus of the focused spectrum should
be nearly perpendicular to the line of vision. For this purpose
Rowland places the eye-piece at O, so that &phi; = 0, and then by (11)
the value of &phi;&prime; in the m<span class="sp">th</span> spectrum is</p>

<p class="center">&sigma; sin &phi;&rsquo; = ± m&lambda; &emsp; &emsp; (12).</p>

<p>If &omega; now relate to the edge of the grating, on which there are
altogether n lines,</p>

<p class="center">n&sigma; = 2a sin &omega;,</p>

<p class="noind">and the value of the last term in (10) becomes</p>

<p class="center"><span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">16 </span>n&sigma;sin³ &omega; sin &phi;&prime; tan &phi;&prime;,</p>

<p class="noind">or</p>

<p class="center"><span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">16 </span>mn&lambda; sin³&omega; tan &phi;&prime; &emsp; &emsp; (13).</p>

<p>This expresses the retardation of the extreme relatively to the
central ray, and is to be reckoned positive, whatever may be the
signs of &omega;, and &phi;&prime;. If the semi-angular aperture (&omega;) be <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">100</span>, and
tan &phi;&prime; = 1, mn might be as great as four millions before the error of
phase would reach ¼&lambda;. If it were desired to use an angular aperture
so large that the aberration according to (13) would be injurious,
Rowland points out that on his machine there would be no difficulty
in applying a remedy by making &sigma; slightly variable towards the
edges. Or, retaining &sigma; constant, we might attain compensation by so
polishing the surface as to bring the circumference slightly forward
in comparison with the position it would occupy upon a true sphere.</p>

<p>It may be remarked that these calculations apply to the rays in
the primary plane only. The image is greatly affected with astigmatism;
but this is of little consequence, if &gamma; in (8) be small enough.
Curvature of the primary focal line having a very injurious effect
upon definition, it may be inferred from the excellent performance
of these gratings that &gamma; is in fact small. Its value does not appear
to have been calculated. The other coefficients in (8) vanish in
virtue of the symmetry.</p>

<p>The mechanical arrangements for maintaining the focus are of
great simplicity. The grating at A and the eye-piece at O are
rigidly attached to a bar AO, whose ends rest on carriages, moving
on rails OQ, AQ at right angles to each other. A tie between the
middle point of the rod OA and Q can be used if thought desirable.</p>

<p>The absence of chromatic aberration gives a great advantage in
the comparison of overlapping spectra, which Rowland has turned
to excellent account in his determinations of the relative wave-lengths
of lines in the solar spectrum (<i>Phil. Mag.</i>, 1887).</p>

<p>For absolute determinations of wave-lengths plane gratings are
used. It is found (Bell, <i>Phil. Mag.</i>, 1887) that the angular
measurements present less difficulty than the comparison of the
grating interval with the standard metre. There is also some
uncertainty as to the actual temperature of the grating when in
use. In order to minimize the heating action of the light, it might
be submitted to a preliminary prismatic analysis before it reaches
the slit of the spectrometer, after the manner of Helmholtz.</p>

<p>In spite of the many improvements introduced by Rowland and
of the care with which his observations were made, recent workers
have come to the conclusion that errors of unexpected amount
have crept into his measurements of wave-lengths, and there is
even a disposition to discard the grating altogether for fundamental
work in favour of the so-called &ldquo;interference methods,&rdquo;
as developed by A. A. Michelson, and by C. Fabry and J. B. Pérot.
The grating would in any case retain its utility for the reference of
new lines to standards otherwise fixed. For such standards
a relative accuracy of at least one part in a million seems now
to be attainable.</p>

<p>Since the time of Fraunhofer many skilled mechanicians have
given their attention to the ruling of gratings. Those of Nobert
were employed by A. J. Ångström in his celebrated researches
upon wave-lengths.  L. M. Rutherfurd introduced into common
use the reflection grating, finding that speculum metal was less
trying than glass to the diamond point, upon the permanence of
which so much depends. In Rowland&rsquo;s dividing engine the
screws were prepared by a special process devised by him, and
the resulting gratings, plane and concave, have supplied the
means for much of the best modern optical work. It would
seem, however, that further improvements are not excluded.</p>

<p>There are various copying processes by which it is possible
to reproduce an original ruling in more or less perfection. The
earliest is that of Quincke, who coated a glass grating with a
chemical silver deposit, subsequently thickened with copper in
an electrolytic bath. The metallic plate thus produced formed,
when stripped from its support, a reflection grating reproducing
many of the characteristics of the original. It is best to commence
the electrolytic thickening in a silver acetate bath. At
the present time excellent reproductions of Rowland&rsquo;s speculum
gratings are on the market (Thorp, Ives, Wallace), prepared, after
a suggestion of Sir David Brewster, by coating the original with a
varnish, <i>e.g.</i> of celluloid. Much skill is required to secure that
the film when stripped shall remain undeformed.</p>

<p>A much easier method, applicable to glass originals, is that
of photographic reproduction by contact printing. In several
papers dating from 1872, Lord Rayleigh (see <i>Collected Papers</i>,
i. 157, 160, 199, 504; iv. 226) has shown that success may
be attained by a variety of processes, including bichromated
gelatin and the old bitumen process, and has investigated the
effect of imperfect approximation during the exposure between the
prepared plate and the original. For many purposes the copies,
containing lines up to 10,000 to the inch, are not inferior. It is
to be desired that transparent gratings should be obtained from
first-class ruling machines. To save the diamond point it might
be possible to use something softer than ordinary glass as the
material of the plate.</p>

<p>9. <i>Talbot&rsquo;s Bands.</i>&mdash;These very remarkable bands are seen
under certain conditions when a tolerably pure spectrum is regarded
with the naked eye, or with a telescope, <i>half the aperture
being covered by a thin plate</i>, <i>e.g.</i> <i>of glass or mica</i>. The view of the
matter taken by the discoverer (<i>Phil. Mag.</i>, 1837, 10, p. 364) was
that any ray which suffered in traversing the plate a retardation
of an odd number of half wave-lengths would be extinguished,
and that thus the spectrum would be seen interrupted by a
number of dark bars. But this explanation cannot be accepted as
it stands, being open to the same objection as Arago&rsquo;s theory of
stellar scintillation.<a name="fa9g" id="fa9g" href="#ft9g"><span class="sp">9</span></a> It is as far as possible from being true that
a body emitting homogeneous light would disappear on merely
covering half the aperture of vision with a half-wave plate.
Such a conclusion would be in the face of the principle of energy,
which teaches plainly that the retardation in question leaves
the aggregate brightness unaltered. The actual formation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>250</span>
the bands comes about in a very curious way, as is shown by a
circumstance first observed by Brewster. When the retarding
plate is held on the side towards the red of the spectrum, <i>the bands
are not seen</i>. Even in the contrary case, the thickness of the plate
must not exceed a certain limit, dependent upon the purity of
the spectrum. A satisfactory explanation of these bands was first
given by Airy (<i>Phil. Trans.</i>, 1840, 225; 1841, 1), but we shall here
follow the investigation of Sir G. G. Stokes (<i>Phil. Trans.</i>, 1848,
227), limiting ourselves, however, to the case where the retarded
and unretarded beams are contiguous and of equal width.</p>

<p>The aperture of the unretarded beam may thus be taken to be
limited by x = -h, x = 0, y = -l, y= +l; and that of the beam retarded
by R to be given by x = 0, x = h, y= -l, y = +l. For the
former (1) § 3 gives</p>

<p>It appears therefore that there are no bands at all unless &omega; lies
between 0 and +4h<span class="su">1</span>, and that within these limits the best bands are
formed at the middle of the range when &omega; = 2h<span class="su">1</span>. The formation
of bands thus requires that the retarding plate be held upon the
side already specified, so that &omega; be positive; and that the thickness
of the plate (to which &omega; is proportional) do not exceed a certain
limit, which we may call 2T<span class="su">0</span>. At the best thickness T<span class="su">0</span> the bands
are black, and not otherwise.</p>

<p>The linear width of the band (e) is the increment of &xi; which alters
&rho; by 2&pi;, so that</p>

<p class="center">e = 2&pi; / <span class="ov">&omega;</span> &emsp; &emsp; (13).</p>

<p class="noind">With the best thickness</p>

<p class="center"><span class="ov">&omega;</span> = 2&pi;h/&lambda;&fnof; &emsp; &emsp; (14),</p>

<p class="noind">so that in this case</p>

<p class="center">e = &lambda;&fnof; / h  &emsp; &emsp; (15).</p>

<p class="noind">The bands are thus of the same width as those due to two infinitely
narrow apertures coincident with the central lines of the retarded
and unretarded streams, the subject of examination being itself a
fine luminous line.</p>

<p>If it be desired to see a given number of bands in the whole or
in any part of the spectrum, the thickness of the retarding plate
is thereby determined, independently of all other considerations.
But in order that the bands may be really visible, and still more in
order that they may be black, another condition must be satisfied.
It is necessary that the aperture of the pupil be accommodated
to the angular extent of the spectrum, or reciprocally. Black
bands will be too fine to be well seen unless the aperture (2h) of
the pupil be somewhat contracted. One-twentieth to one-fiftieth
of an inch is suitable. The aperture and the number of bands being
both fixed, the condition of blackness determines the angular magnitude
of a band and of the spectrum. The use of a grating is very
convenient, for not only are there several spectra in view at the same
time, but the dispersion can be varied continuously by sloping the
grating. The slits may be cut out of tin-plate, and half covered by
mica or &ldquo;microscopic glass,&rdquo; held in position by a little cement.</p>

<p>If a telescope be employed there is a distinction to be observed,
according as the half-covered aperture is between the eye and the
ocular, or in front of the object-glass. In the former case the
function of the telescope is simply to increase the dispersion, and
the formation of the bands is of course independent of the particular
manner in which the dispersion arises. If, however, the
half-covered aperture be in front of the object-glass, the phenomenon
is magnified as a whole, and the desirable relation between
the (unmagnified) dispersion and the aperture is the same as without
the telescope. There appears to be no further advantage in the
use of a telescope than the increased facility of accommodation,
and for this of course a very low power suffices.</p>

<p>The original investigation of Stokes, here briefly sketched, extends
also to the case where the streams are of unequal width h, k,
and are separated by an interval 2g. In the case of unequal width
the bands cannot be black; but if h = k, the finiteness of 2g does
not preclude the formation of black bands.</p>

<p>The theory of Talbot&rsquo;s bands with a half-covered <i>circular</i> aperture
has been considered by H. Struve (<i>St Peters. Trans.</i>, 1883, 31, No. 1).</p>

<p>The subject of &ldquo;Talbot&rsquo;s bands&rdquo; has been treated in a very
instructive manner by A. Schuster (<i>Phil. Mag.</i>, 1904), whose point
of view offers the great advantage of affording an instantaneous
explanation of the peculiarity noticed by Brewster. A plane
<i>pulse</i>, <i>i.e.</i> a disturbance limited to an infinitely thin slice of the
medium, is supposed to fall upon a parallel grating, which again may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>251</span>
be regarded as formed of infinitely thin wires, or infinitely narrow
lines traced upon glass. The secondary pulses diverted by the ruling
fall upon an object-glass as usual, and on arrival at the focus
constitute a procession equally spaced in time, the interval between
consecutive members depending upon the obliquity. If a retarding
plate be now inserted so as to operate upon the pulses which come
from one side of the grating, while leaving the remainder unaffected,
we have to consider what happens at the focal point chosen. A full
discussion would call for the formal application of Fourier&rsquo;s theorem,
but some conclusions of importance are almost obvious.</p>

<p>Previously to the introduction of the plate we have an effect
corresponding to wave-lengths closely grouped around the principal
wave-length, viz. &sigma; sin &phi;, where &sigma; is the grating-interval and &phi; the
obliquity, the closeness of the grouping increasing with the number
of intervals. In addition to these wave-lengths there are other groups
centred round the wave-lengths which are submultiples of the
principal one&mdash;the overlapping spectra of the second and higher
orders. Suppose now that the plate is introduced so as to cover naif
the aperture and that it retards those pulses which would otherwise
arrive first. The consequences must depend upon the amount of the
retardation. As this increases from zero, the two processions which
correspond to the two halves of the aperture begin to overlap, and
the overlapping gradually increases until there is almost complete
superposition. The stage upon which we will fix our attention is
that where the one procession bisects the intervals between the
other, so that a new simple procession is constituted, containing the
same number of members as before the insertion of the plate, but
now spaced at intervals only half as great. It is evident that the
effect at the focal point is the obliteration of the first and other
spectra of odd order, so that as regards the spectrum of the first order
we may consider that the two beams <i>interfere</i>. The formation of
black bands is thus explained, and it requires that the plate be
introduced upon one particular side, and that the amount of the
retardation be adjusted to a particular value. If the retardation
be too little, the overlapping of the processions is incomplete, so that
besides the procession of half period there are residues of the original
processions of full period. The same thing occurs if the retardation
be too great. If it exceed the double of the value necessary for
black bands, there is again no overlapping and consequently no
interference. If the plate be introduced upon the other side, so as
to retard the procession originally in arrear, there is no overlapping,
whatever may be the amount of retardation. In this way the
principal features of the phenomenon are accounted for, and
Schuster has shown further how to extend the results to spectra
having their origin in prisms instead of gratings.</p>

<p>10. <i>Diffraction when the Source of Light is not seen in Focus.</i>&mdash;The
phenomena to be considered under this head are of less
importance than those investigated by Fraunhofer, and will be
treated in less detail; but in view of their historical interest and
of the ease with which many of the experiments may be tried,
some account of their theory cannot be omitted. One or two
examples have already attracted our attention when considering
Fresnel&rsquo;s zones, viz. the shadow of a circular disk and of a screen
circularly perforated.</p>

<p>Fresnel commenced his researches with an examination of the
fringes, external and internal, which accompany the shadow of a
narrow opaque strip, such as a wire. As a source of light he used
sunshine passing through a very small hole perforated in a metal
plate, or condensed by a lens of short focus. In the absence of a
heliostat the latter was the more convenient. Following, unknown
to himself, in the footsteps of Young, he deduced the
principle of interference from the circumstance that the darkness
of the interior bands requires the co-operation of light from both
sides of the obstacle. At first, too, he followed Young in the view
that the exterior bands are the result of interference between the
direct light and that reflected from the edge of the obstacle, but
he soon discovered that the character of the edge&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> whether
it was the cutting edge or the back of a razor&mdash;made no material
difference, and was thus led to the conclusion that the explanation
of these phenomena requires nothing more than the application of
Huygens&rsquo;s principle to the unobstructed parts of the wave. In
observing the bands he received them at first upon a screen of
finely ground glass, upon which a magnifying lens was focused;
but it soon appeared that the ground glass could be dispensed with,
the diffraction pattern being viewed in the same way as the image
formed by the object-glass of a telescope is viewed through the
eye-piece. This simplification was attended by a great saving of
light, allowing measures to be taken such as would otherwise have
presented great difficulties.</p>

<p>In theoretical investigations these problems are usually treated
as of two dimensions only, everything being referred to the plane
passing through the luminous point and perpendicular to the diffracting
edges, supposed to be straight and parallel. In strictness this
idea is appropriate only when the source is a luminous line, emitting
cylindrical waves, such as might be obtained from a luminous point
with the aid of a cylindrical lens. When, in order to apply Huygens&rsquo;s
principle, the wave is supposed to be broken up, the phase is the same
at every element of the surface of resolution which lies upon a line
perpendicular to the plane of reference, and
thus the effect of the whole line, or rather
infinitesimal strip, is related in a constant
manner to that of the element which lies
in the plane of reference, and may be
considered to be represented thereby. The
same method of representation is applicable
to spherical waves, issuing from a <i>point</i>, if
the radius of curvature be large; for, although
there is variation of phase along the
length of the infinitesimal strip, the whole effect depends practically
upon that of the central parts where the phase is sensibly constant.<a name="fa10g" id="fa10g" href="#ft10g"><span class="sp">10</span></a></p>

<p>In fig. 17 APQ is the arc of the circle representative of the wave-front
of resolution, the centre being at O, and the radius QA being

a + b from O, so that AB = b, AP = s, PQ = ds.</p>

<p>Now in the integrals represented by G and H every element
diminishes as V increases from zero. Hence,
as CA increases, viz. as the point P is more
and more deeply immersed in the shadow,
the illumination <i>continuously</i> decreases, and
that without limit. It has long been known
from observation that there are no bands
on the interior side of the shadow of the
edge.</p>

<p>The law of diminution when V is moderately
large is easily expressed with the aid
of the series (16), (17) for G, H. We have
ultimately G = 0, H = (&pi;V)<span class="sp">&minus;1</span>, so that</p>

<p class="noind">or the illumination is inversely as the square

fluctuations giving rise to bright and dark bands. The position
of these bands determined by (23) may be very simply expressed

width of the source of light, in order that the bands may be properly
formed. If &omega; be the apparent magnitude of the source seen from A,

<p>A very thorough investigation of this and other related questions,
accompanied by fully worked-out tables of the functions concerned,
will be found in a paper by E. Lommel (<i>Abh. bayer. Akad. d. Wiss.</i>

<p>When the functions C and S have once been calculated, the
discussion of various diffraction problems is much facilitated by
the idea, due to M. A. Cornu (<i>Journ. de Phys.</i>, 1874, 3, p. 1; a similar
suggestion was made independently by G. F. Fitzgerald), of exhibiting
as a curve the relationship between C and S, considered as the
rectangular co-ordinates (x, y) of a point. Such a curve is shown in
fig. 19, where, according to the definition (5) of C, S,</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">

<p class="noind">The origin of co-ordinates O corresponds to v = 0; and the asymptotic

<p>The intrinsic equation, expressing the relation between the arc
&sigma; (measured from O) and the inclination &phi; of the tangent at any
points to the axis of x, assumes a very simple form. For</p>

<p>Cornu remarks that this equation suffices to determine the general
character of the curve. For the osculating circle at any point
includes the whole of the
curve which lies beyond;
and the successive convolutions
envelop one another
without intersection.</p>

<p>The utility of the curve
depends upon the fact that
the elements of arc represent,
in amplitude and
phase, the component vibrations
due to the corresponding
portions of the
primary wave-front. For
by (30) d&sigma; = dv, and by
(2) dv is proportional to ds.
Moreover by (2) and (31)
the retardation of phase of
the elementary vibration
from PQ (fig. 17) is 2&pi;&delta;/&lambda;,
or &phi;. Hence, in accordance
with the rule for compounding vector quantities, the resultant
vibration at B, due to any finite part of the primary wave, is
represented in amplitude and phase by the chord joining the extremities
of the corresponding arc (&sigma;<span class="su">2</span> &minus; &sigma;<span class="su">1</span>).</p>

<p>In applying the curve in special cases of diffraction to exhibit
the effect at any point P (fig. 18) the centre of the curve O is to be
considered to correspond to that point C of the primary wave-front
which lies nearest to P. The operative part, or parts, of the curve
are of course those which represent the unobstructed portions of
the primary wave.</p>

<p>Let us reconsider, following Cornu, the diffraction of a screen
unlimited on one side, and on the other terminated by a straight
edge. On the illuminated side, at a distance from the shadow, the
vibration is represented by JJ&prime;. The co-ordinates of J, J&prime; being
(½, ½), (&minus;½, &minus;½), I² is 2; and the phase is <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> period in arrear of
that of the element at O. As the point under contemplation is
supposed to approach the shadow, the vibration is represented by the
chord drawn from J to a point on the other half of the curve, which
travels inwards from J&prime; towards O. The amplitude is thus subject
to fluctuations, which increase as the shadow is approached. At
the point O the intensity is one-quarter of that of the entire wave,
and after this point is passed, that is, when we have entered the
geometrical shadow, the intensity falls off gradually to zero, <i>without
fluctuations</i>. The whole progress of the phenomenon is thus exhibited
to the eye in a very instructive manner.</p>

<p>We will next suppose that the light is transmitted by a slit, and
inquire what is the effect of varying the width of the slit upon the
illumination at the projection of its centre. Under these circumstances
the arc to be considered is bisected at O, and its length is
proportional to the width of the slit. It is easy to see that the
length of the chord (which passes in all cases through O) increases
to a maximum near the place where the phase-retardation is <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> of
a period, then diminishes to a minimum when the retardation is
about <span class="spp">7</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> of a period, and so on.</p>

<p>If the slit is of constant width and we require the illumination
at various points on the screen behind it, we must regard the arc
of the curve as of <i>constant length</i>. The intensity is then, as always,
represented by the square of the length of the chord. If the slit
be narrow, so that the arc is short, the intensity is constant over
a wide range, and does not fall off to an important extent until
the discrepancy of the extreme phases reaches about a quarter of a
period.</p>

<p>We have hitherto supposed that the shadow of a diffracting
obstacle is received upon a diffusing screen, or, which comes to
nearly the same thing, is observed with an eye-piece. If the eye,
provided if necessary with a perforated plate in order to reduce the
aperture, be situated inside the shadow at a place where the illumination
is still sensible, and be focused upon the diffracting edge, the
light which it receives will appear to come from the neighbourhood
of the edge, and will present the effect of a silver lining. This is
doubtless the explanation of a &ldquo;pretty optical phenomenon, seen
in Switzerland, when the sun rises from behind distant trees standing
on the summit of a mountain.&rdquo;<a name="fa11g" id="fa11g" href="#ft11g"><span class="sp">11</span></a></p>

<p>II. <i>Dynamical Theory of Diffraction.</i>&mdash;The explanation of
diffraction phenomena given by Fresnel and his followers is
independent of special views as to the nature of the aether, at least
in its main features; for in the absence of a more complete
foundation it is impossible to treat rigorously the mode of action
of a solid obstacle such as a screen. But, without entering upon
matters of this kind, we may inquire in what manner a primary
wave may be resolved into elementary secondary waves, and
in particular as to the law of intensity and polarization in a
secondary wave as dependent upon its direction of propagation,
and upon the character as regards polarization of the primary
wave. This question was treated by Stokes in his &ldquo;Dynamical
Theory of Diffraction&rdquo; (<i>Camb. Phil. Trans.</i>, 1849) on the basis
of the elastic solid theory.</p>

<p>Let x, y, z be the co-ordinates of any particle of the medium in
its natural state, and &chi;, &eta;, &zeta; the displacements of the same particle
at the end of time t, measured in the directions of the three axes

medium is regarded as absolutely incompressible &delta; vanishes; but,
in order that equations (2) may preserve their generality, we must
suppose a at the same time to become infinite, and replace a²&delta; by
a new function of the co-ordinates.</p>

<p>These equations simplify very much in their application to plane
waves. If the ray be parallel to OX, and the direction of vibration
parallel to OZ, we have &xi; = 0, &eta; = 0, while &zeta; is a function of x and
t only. Equation (1) and the first pair of equations (2) are thus
satisfied identically. The third equation gives</p>

<p class="noind">where &fnof; is an arbitrary function.</p>

<p>The question as to the law of the secondary waves is thus answered
by Stokes. &ldquo;Let &xi; = 0, &eta; = 0, &zeta; = &fnof;(bt &minus; x) be the displacements
corresponding to the incident light; let O<span class="su">1</span> be any point in the plane
P (of the wave-front), dS an element of that plane adjacent to O<span class="su">1</span>,
and consider the disturbance due to that portion only of the incident
disturbance which passes continually across dS. Let O be any point
in the medium situated at a distance from the point O<span class="su">1</span> which is
large in comparison with the length of a wave; let O<span class="su">1</span>O = r, and let
this line make an angle &theta; with the direction of propagation of the
incident light, or the axis of x, and &phi; with the direction of vibration,
or axis of z. Then the displacement at O will take place in a direction
perpendicular to O<span class="su">1</span>O, and lying in the plane ZO<span class="su">1</span>O; and, if &zeta;&prime; be the
displacement at O, reckoned positive in the direction nearest to
that in which the incident vibrations are reckoned positive,</p>

<p class="noind">It is then verified that, after integration with respect to dS, (6)
gives the same disturbance as if the primary wave had been supposed
to pass on unbroken.</p>

<p>The occurrence of sin &phi; as a factor in (6) shows that the relative
intensities of the primary light and of that diffracted in the direction
&theta; depend upon the condition of the former as regards polarization.
If the direction of primary vibration be perpendicular to
the plane of diffraction (containing both primary and secondary
rays), sin &phi; = 1; but, if the primary vibration be in the plane of
diffraction, sin &phi; = cos &theta;. This result was employed by Stokes as
a criterion of the direction of vibration; and his experiments, conducted
with gratings, led him to the conclusion that the vibrations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>254</span>
of polarized light are executed in a direction <i>perpendicular</i> to the
plane of polarization.</p>

<p>The factor (1 + cos &theta;) shows in what manner the secondary disturbance
depends upon the direction in which it is propagated with
respect to the front of the primary wave.</p>

<p>If, as suffices for all practical purposes, we limit the application
of the formulae to points in advance of the plane at which the wave
is supposed to be broken up, we may use simpler methods of resolution
than that above considered. It appears indeed that the purely
mathematical question has no definite answer. In illustration of
this the analogous problem for sound may be referred to. Imagine
a flexible lamina to be introduced so as to coincide with the plane
at which resolution is to be effected. The introduction of the lamina
(supposed to be devoid of inertia) will make no difference to the
propagation of plane parallel sonorous waves through the position
which it occupies. At every point the motion of the lamina will be
the same as would have occurred in its absence, the pressure of the
waves impinging from behind being just what is required to generate
the waves in front. Now it is evident that the aerial motion in front
of the lamina is determined by what happens at the lamina without
regard to the cause of the motion there existing. Whether the
necessary forces are due to aerial pressures acting on the rear, or to
forces directly impressed from without, is a matter of indifference.
The conception of the lamina leads immediately to two schemes,
according to which a primary wave may be supposed to be broken
up. In the first of these the element dS, the effect of which is to be
estimated, is supposed to execute its actual motion, while every other
element of the plane lamina is maintained at rest. The resulting
aerial motion in front is readily calculated (see Rayleigh, <i>Theory of
Sound</i>, § 278); it is symmetrical with respect to the origin, <i>i.e.</i> independent
of &theta;. When the secondary disturbance thus obtained is
integrated with respect to dS over the entire plane of the lamina, the
result is necessarily the same as would have been obtained had the
primary wave been supposed to pass on without resolution, for this
is precisely the motion generated when every element of the lamina
vibrates with a common motion, equal to that attributed to dS.
The only assumption here involved is the evidently legitimate one
that, when two systems of variously distributed motion at the
lamina are superposed, the corresponding motions in front are
superposed also.</p>

<p>The method of resolution just described is the simplest, but it is
only one of an indefinite number that might be proposed, and which
are all equally legitimate, so long as the question is regarded as a
merely mathematical one, without reference to the physical properties
of actual screens. If, instead of supposing the <i>motion</i> at dS
to be that of the primary wave, and to be zero elsewhere, we suppose
the <i>force</i> operative over the element dS of the lamina to be that
corresponding to the primary wave, and to vanish elsewhere, we
obtain a secondary wave following quite a different law. In this
case the motion in different directions varies as cos&theta;, vanishing at
right angles to the direction of propagation of the primary wave.
Here again, on integration over the entire lamina, the aggregate
effect of the secondary waves is necessarily the same as that of the
primary.</p>

<p>In order to apply these ideas to the investigation of the secondary
wave of light, we require the solution of a problem, first treated
by Stokes, viz. the determination of the motion in an infinitely
extended elastic solid due to a locally applied periodic force. If
we suppose that the force impressed upon the element of mass
D dx dy dz is</p>

<p class="center">DZ dx dy dz,</p>

<p class="noind">being everywhere parallel to the axis of Z, the only change required
in our equations (1), (2) is the addition of the term Z to the second
member of the third equation (2). In the forced vibration, now
under consideration, Z, and the quantities &xi;, &eta;, &zeta;, &delta; expressing the
resulting motion, are to be supposed proportional to e<span class="sp">int</span>, where
i = &radic;(-1),   and n = 2&pi;/&tau;, &tau; being the periodic time. Under these
circumstances the double differentiation with respect to t of any
quantity is equivalent to multiplication by the factor -n², and thus
our equations take the form</p>

<p class="center">&zeta; = sin(nt &minus; kx)&emsp;&emsp;(19)</p>

<p class="noind">is supposed to be broken up in passing the plane x = 0. The first step
is to calculate the force which represents the reaction between the
parts of the medium separated by x = 0. The force operative upon
the positive half is parallel to OZ, and of amount per unit of area
equal to</p>

<p class="center">&minus;b²D d&zeta;/dx = b²kD cos nt;</p>

may be supposed to be that caused by a force of the above magnitude

examine what the result of such a force would be.</p>

upon the positive half only of the medium, produces just double of
the effect that would be caused by the same force if the medium
were undivided, and on the latter supposition (being also localized

<p class="noind">regard being had to (12). This therefore expresses the secondary
disturbance at a distance r and in a direction making an angle &phi;
with OZ (the direction of primary vibration) due to the element dS
of the wave-front.</p>

<p>The proportionality of the secondary disturbance to sin &phi; is
common to the present law and to that given by Stokes, but here
there is no dependence upon the angle &theta; between the primary and
secondary rays. The occurrence of the factor &lambda;r<span class="sp">&minus;1</span>, and the
necessity of supposing the phase of the secondary wave accelerated
by a quarter of an undulation, were first established by Archibald
Smith, as the result of a comparison between the primary wave,
supposed to pass on without resolution, and the integrated effect
of all the secondary waves (§ 2). The occurrence of factors such
as sin &phi;, or ½(1 + cos &theta;), in the expression of the secondary wave
has no influence upon the result of the integration, the effects of
all the elements for which the factors differ appreciably from unity
being destroyed by mutual interference.</p>

<p>The choice between various methods of resolution, all mathematically
admissible, would be guided by physical considerations
respecting the mode of action of obstacles. Thus, to refer again to
the acoustical analogue in which plane waves are incident upon
a perforated rigid screen, the circumstances of the case are best
represented by the first method of resolution, leading to symmetrical
secondary waves, in which the normal motion is supposed to be zero
over the unperforated parts. Indeed, if the aperture is very small,
this method gives the correct result, save as to a constant factor. In
like manner our present law (20) would apply to the kind of obstruction
that would be caused by an actual physical division of the elastic
medium, extending over the whole of the area supposed to be occupied
by the intercepting screen, but of course not extending to the parts
supposed to be perforated.</p>

<p>On the electromagnetic theory, the problem of diffraction becomes
definite when the properties of the obstacle are laid down. The
simplest supposition is that the material composing the obstacle
is perfectly conducting, <i>i.e.</i> perfectly reflecting. On this basis
A. J. W. Sommerfeld (<i>Math. Ann.</i>, 1895, 47, p. 317), with great mathematical
skill, has solved the problem of the shadow thrown by a
semi-infinite plane screen. A simplified exposition has been given by
Horace Lamb (<i>Proc. Lond. Math. Soc.</i>, 1906, 4, p. 190). It appears that
Fresnel&rsquo;s results, although based on an imperfect theory, require only
insignificant corrections. Problems not limited to two dimensions,
such for example as the shadow of a circular disk, present great
difficulties, and have not hitherto been treated by a rigorous method;
but there is no reason to suppose that Fresnel&rsquo;s results would be
departed from materially.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIFFUSION<a name="ar85" id="ar85"></a></span> (from the Lat. <i>diffundere; dis-</i>, asunder, and
<i>fundere</i>, to pour out), in general, a spreading out, scattering
or circulation; in physics the term is applied to a special
phenomenon, treated below.</p>

<p>1. <i>General Description.</i>&mdash;When two different substances are
placed in contact with each other they sometimes remain
separate, but in many cases a gradual mixing takes place. In the
case where both the substances are gases the process of mixing
continues until the result is a uniform mixture. In other cases
the proportions in which two different substances can mix
lie between certain fixed limits, but the mixture is distinguished
from a chemical compound by the fact that between these limits
the composition of the mixture is capable of continuous variation,
while in chemical compounds, the proportions of the different
constituents can only have a discrete series of numerical values,
each different ratio representing a different compound. If we
take, for example, air and water in the presence of each other, air
will become dissolved in the water, and water will evaporate into
the air, and the proportions of either constituent absorbed by the
other will vary continuously. But a limit will come when the air
will absorb no more water, and the water will absorb no more air,
and throughout the change a definite surface of separation will
exist between the liquid and the gaseous parts. When no surface
of separation ever exists between two substances they must
necessarily be capable of mixing in all proportions. If they are
not capable of mixing in all proportions a discontinuous change
must occur somewhere between the regions where the substances
are still unmixed, thus giving rise to a surface of separation.</p>

<p>The phenomena of mixing thus involves the following processes:&mdash;(1)
A motion of the substances relative to one another
throughout a definite <i>region</i> of space in which mixing is taking
place. This relative motion is called &ldquo;diffusion.&rdquo; (2) The passage
of portions of the mixing substances across the <i>surface</i> of
separation when such a surface exists. These surface actions
are described under various terms such as solution, evaporation,
condensation and so forth. For example, when a soluble salt is
placed in a liquid, the process which occurs at the surface of the
salt is called &ldquo;solution,&rdquo; but the salt which enters the liquid by
solution is transported from the surface into the interior of the
liquid by &ldquo;diffusion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Diffusion may take place in solids, that is, in regions occupied
by matter which continues to exhibit the properties of the solid
state. Thus if two liquids which can mix are separated by a
membrane or partition, the mixing may take place through the
membrane. If a solution of salt is separated from pure water by
a sheet of parchment, part of the salt will pass through the parchment
into the water. If water and glycerin are separated in this
way most of the water will pass into the glycerin and a little
glycerin will pass through in the opposite direction, a property
frequently used by microscopists for the purpose of gradually
transferring minute algae from water into glycerin. A still more
interesting series of examples is afforded by the passage of gases
through partitions of metal, notably the passage of hydrogen
through platinum and palladium at high temperatures. When
the process is considered with reference to a membrane or partition
taken as a whole, the passage of a substance from one side to the
other is commonly known as &ldquo;osmosis&rdquo; or &ldquo;transpiration&rdquo;
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Solution</a></span>), but what occurs in the material of the membrane
itself is correctly described as diffusion.</p>

<p>Simple cases of diffusion are easily observed qualitatively. If a
solution of a coloured salt is carefully introduced by a funnel into
the bottom of a jar containing water, the two portions will at first
be fairly well defined, but if the mixture can exist in all proportions,
the surface of separation will gradually disappear; and the
rise of the colour into the upper part and its gradual weakening
in the lower part, may be watched for days, weeks or even longer
intervals. The diffusion of a strong aniline colouring matter into
the interior of gelatine is easily observed, and is commonly seen in
copying apparatus. Diffusion of gases may be shown to exist by
taking glass jars containing vapours of hydrochloric acid and
ammonia, and placing them in communication with the heavier
gas downmost. The precipitation of ammonium chloride shows
that diffusion exists, though the chemical action prevents this
example from forming a typical case of diffusion. Again, when
a film of Canada balsam is enclosed between glass plates, the
disappearance during a few weeks of small air bubbles enclosed
in the balsam can be watched under the microscope.</p>

<p>In fluid media, whether liquids or gases, the process of mixing
is greatly accelerated by stirring or agitating the fluids, and
liquids which might take years to mix if left to themselves
can thus be mixed in a few seconds. It is necessary to carefully
distinguish the effects of agitation from those of diffusion proper.
By shaking up two liquids which do not mix we split them up
into a large number of different portions, and so greatly increase
the area of the surface of separation, besides decreasing the
thicknesses of the various portions. But even when we produce
the appearance of a uniform turbid mixture, the small portions
remain quite distinct. If however the fluids can really mix, the
final process must in every case depend on diffusion, and all we
do by shaking is to increase the sectional area, and decrease the
thickness of the diffusing portions, thus rendering the completion
of the operation more rapid. If a gas is shaken up in a liquid
the process of absorption of the bubbles is also accelerated by
capillary action, as occurs in an ordinary sparklet bottle. To
state the matter precisely, however finely two fluids have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>256</span>
subdivided by agitation, the molecular constitution of the
different portions remains unchanged. The ultimate process
by which the individual molecules of two different substances
become mixed, producing finally a homogeneous mixture, is in
every case diffusion. In other words, diffusion is that relative
motion of the molecules of two different substances by which the
proportions of the molecules in any region containing a finite
number of molecules are changed.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In order, therefore, to make accurate observations of diffusion in
fluids it is necessary to guard against any cause which may set up
currents; and in some cases this is exceedingly difficult. Thus, if
gas is absorbed at the upper surface of a liquid, and if the gaseous
solution is heavier than the pure liquid, currents may be set up, and
a steady state of diffusion may cease to exist. This has been tested
experimentally by C. G. von Hüfner and W. E. Adney. The same
thing may happen when a gas is evolved into a liquid at the surface
of a solid even if no bubbles are formed; thus if pieces of aluminium
are placed in caustic soda, the currents set up by the evolution of
hydrogen are sufficient to set the aluminium pieces in motion, and
it is probable that the motions of the Diatomaceae are similarly
caused by the evolution of oxygen. In some pairs of substances
diffusion may take place more rapidly than in others. Of course the
progress of events in any experiment necessarily depends on various
causes, such as the size of the containing vessels, but it is easy to see
that when experiments with different substances are carried out under
similar conditions, however these &ldquo;similar conditions&rdquo; be defined,
the rates of diffusion must be capable of numerical comparison, and
the results must be expressible in terms of at least one physical
quantity, which for any two substances can be called their coefficient
of diffusion. How to select this quantity we shall see later.</p>
</div>

<p>2 <i>Quantitative Methods of observing Diffusion.</i>&mdash;The simplest
plan of determining the progress of diffusion between two liquids
would be to draw off and examine portions from different strata
at some stage in the process; the disturbance produced would,
however, interfere with the subsequent process of diffusion, and
the observations could not be continued. By placing in the
liquid column hollow glass beads of different average densities,
and observing at what height they remain suspended, it is
possible to trace the variations of density of the liquid column
at different depths, and different times. In this method, which
was originally introduced by Lord Kelvin, difficulties were
caused by the adherence of small air bubbles to the beads.</p>

<p>In general, optical methods are the most capable of giving
exact results, and the following may be distinguished, (a) <i>By
refraction in a horizontal plane.</i> If the containing vessel is in
the form of a prism, the deviation of a horizontal ray of light in
passing through the prism determines the index of refraction,
and consequently the density of the stratum through which the
ray passes, (b) <i>By refraction in a vertical plane.</i> Owing to the
density varying with the depth, a horizontal ray entering the
liquid also undergoes a small vertical deviation, being bent
downwards towards the layers of greater density. The observation
of this vertical deviation determines not the actual density,
but its rate of variation with the depth, <i>i.e.</i> the &ldquo;density gradient&rdquo;
at any point, (c) <i>By the saccharimeter.</i> In the cases of solutions
of sugar, which cause rotation of the plane of polarized light,
the density of the sugar at any depth may be determined by
observing the corresponding angle of rotation, this was done
originally by W. Voigt.</p>

<p>3. <i>Elementary Definitions of Coefficient of Diffusion.</i>&mdash;The
simplest case of diffusion is that of a substance, say a gas, diffusing
in the interior of a homogeneous solid medium, which remains at
rest, when no external forces act on the system. We may regard
it as the result of experience that: (1) if the density of the diffusing
substance is everywhere the same no diffusion takes place, and
(2) if the density of the diffusing substance is different at different
points, diffusion will take place from places of greater to those of
lesser density, and will not cease until the density is everywhere
the same. It follows that the rate of flow of the diffusing substance
at any point in any direction must depend on the density
gradient at that point in that direction, <i>i.e.</i> on the rate at which
the density of the diffusing substance decreases as we move in
that direction. We may define the <i>coefficient of diffusion</i> as the
ratio of the total mass per unit area which flows across any
small section, to the rate of decrease of the density per unit
distance in a direction perpendicular to that section.</p>

<p>In the case of steady diffusion parallel to the axis of x, if &rho; be the
density of the diffusing substance, and q the mass which flows across
a unit of area in a plane perpendicular to the axis of x, then the density
gradient is -d&rho;/dx and the ratio of q to this is called the &ldquo;coefficient
of diffusion.&rdquo; By what has been said this ratio remains finite, however
small the actual gradient and flow may be., and it is natural
to assume, at any rate as a first approximation, that it is constant
as far as the quantities in question are concerned. Thus if the
coefficient of diffusion be denoted by K we have q= -K(d&rho;/dx).</p>

<p>Further, the rate at which the quantity of substance is increasing
in an element between the distances x and x+dx is equal to the
difference of the rates of flow in and out of the two faces, whence as
in hydrodynamics, we have d&rho;/dt =-dq/dx.</p>

<p>It follows that the equation of diffusion in this case assumes the
form</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr><td>d&rho;</td> <td rowspan="2">=</td> <td>d</td>
<td rowspan="2"><span class="f150">(</span> K</td> <td>d&rho;</td>
<td rowspan="2"><span class="f150">)</span>,</td></tr>
<tr><td class="denom">dt</td> <td class="denom">dx</td> <td class="denom">dx</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">which is identical with the equations representing conduction of
heat, flow of electricity and other physical phenomena. For motion
in three dimensions we have in like manner</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr><td>d&rho;</td> <td rowspan="2">=</td> <td>d</td>
<td rowspan="2"><span class="f150">(</span> K</td> <td>d&rho;</td>

<td class="denom">dx </td> <td class="denom">dy</td>
<td class="denom">dy</td> <td class="denom">dz</td> <td class="denom">dz</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">and the corresponding equations in electricity and heat for anisotropic
substances would be available to account for any parallel
phenomena, which may arise, or might be conceived, to exist in
connexion with diffusion through a crystalline solid.</p>

<p>In the case of a very dilute solution, the coefficient of diffusion
of the dissolved substance can be defined in the same way as
when the diffusion takes place in a solid, because the effects of
diffusion will not have any perceptible influence on the solvent,
and the latter may therefore be regarded as remaining practically
at rest. But in most cases of diffusion between two fluids, both
of the fluids are in motion, and hence there is far greater difficulty
in determining the motion, and even in defining the coefficient of
diffusion. It is important to notice in the first instance, that it
is only the relative motion of the two substances which constitutes
diffusion. Thus when a current of air is blowing, under
ordinary circumstances the changes which take place are purely
mechanical, and do not depend on the separate diffusions of the
oxygen and nitrogen of which the air is mainly composed. It is
only when two gases are flowing with unequal velocity, that
is, when they have a relative motion, that these changes of
relative distribution, which are called diffusion, take place. The
best way out of the difficulty is to investigate the separate motions
of the two fluids, taking account of the mechanical actions
exerted on them, and supposing that the mutual action of the
fluids causes either fluid to resist the relative motion of the other.</p>

<p>4. <i>The Coefficient of Resistance.</i>&mdash;Let us call the two diffusing
fluids A and B. If B were absent, the motion of the fluid A
would be determined entirely by the variations of pressure of the
fluid A, and by the external forces, such as that due to gravity
acting on A. Similarly if A were absent, the motion of B would
be determined entirely by the variations of pressure due to the
fluid B, and by the external forces acting on B. When both
fluids are mixed together, each fluid tends to resist the relative
motion of the other, and by the law of equality of action and
reaction, the resistance which A experiences from B is everywhere
equal and opposite to the resistance which B experiences
from A. If the amount of this resistance per unit volume be
divided by the relative velocity of the two fluids, and also by the
product of their densities, the quotient is called the &ldquo;coefficient of
resistance.&rdquo; If then &rho;<span class="su">1</span>, &rho;<span class="su">2</span> are the densities cf the two fluids,
u<span class="su">1</span>, u<span class="su">2</span> their velocities, C the coefficient of resistance, then the
portion of the fluid A contained in a small element of volume v
will experience from the fluid B a resistance C&rho;<span class="su">1</span>&rho;<span class="su">2</span>v(u<span class="su">1</span> &minus; u<span class="su">2</span>), and
the fluid B contained in the same volume element will experience
from the fluid A an equal and opposite resistance, C&rho;<span class="su">1</span>&rho;<span class="su">2</span>v(u<span class="su">2</span> &minus; u<span class="su">1</span>).</p>

<p>This definition implies the following laws of resistance to
diffusion, which must be regarded as based on experience, and
not as self-evident truths: (1) each fluid tends to assume, so far
as diffusion is concerned, the same equüibrium distribution that
it would assume if its motion were unresisted by the presence of
the other fluid. (Of course, the mutual attraction of gravitation
of the two fluids might affect the final distribution, but this is
practically negligible. Leaving such actions as this out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>257</span>
account the following statement is correct.) In a state of
equilibrium, the density of each fluid at any point thus depends
only on the partial pressure of that fluid alone, and is the same
as if the other fluids were absent. It does not depend on the
partial pressures of the other fluids. If this were not the case,
the resistance to diffusion would be analogous to friction, and
would contain terms which were independent of the relative
velocity u<span class="su">2</span> &minus; u<span class="su">1</span>. (2) For slow motions the resistance to diffusion
is (approximately at any rate) proportional to the relative
velocity. (3) The coefficient of resistance C is not necessarily
always constant; it may, for example, and, in general, does,
depend on the temperature.</p>

<p>If we form the equations of hydrodynamics for the different fluids
occurring in any mixture, taking account of diffusion, but neglecting
viscosity, and using suffixes 1, 2 to denote the separate fluids, these
assume the form given by James Clerk Maxwell (&ldquo;Diffusion,&rdquo; in
<i>Ency. Brit.</i>, 9th ed.):&mdash;</p>

<tr><td class="denom">Dt</td> <td class="denom">dt</td>
<td class="denom">dx</td> <td class="denom">dy</td> <td class="denom">dz</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">and these equations imply that when diffusion and other motions
cease, the fluids satisfy the separate conditions of equilibrium
dp<span class="su">1</span>/dx &minus; X<span class="su">1</span>&rho;<span class="su">1</span> = 0. The assumption made in the following account is
that terms such as Du<span class="su">1</span>/Dt may be neglected in the cases considered.</p>

<p>A further property based on experience is that the motions set
up in a mixture by diffusion are very slow compared with those
set up by mechanical actions, such as differences of pressure.
Thus, if two gases at equal temperature and pressure be allowed
to mix by diffusion, the heavier gas being below the lighter, the
process will take a long time; on the other hand, if two gases,
or parts of the same gas, at different pressures be connected,
equalization of pressure will take place almost immediately.
It follows from this property that the forces required to overcome
the &ldquo;inertia&rdquo; of the fluids in the motions due to diffusion are
quite imperceptible. At any stage of the process, therefore, any
one of the diffusing fluids may be regarded as in equilibrium under
the action of its own partial pressure, the external forces to which
it is subjected and the resistance to diffusion of the other fluids.</p>

<p>5. <i>Slow Diffusion of two Gases. Relation between the Coefficients
of Resistance and of Diffusion.</i>&mdash;We now suppose the
diffusing substances to be two gases which obey Boyle&rsquo;s law, and
that diffusion takes place in a closed cylinder or tube of unit
sectional area at constant temperature, the surfaces of equal
density being perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder, so that the
direction of diffusion is along the length of the cylinder, and we
suppose no external forces, such as gravity, to act on the system.</p>

<p>The densities of the gases are denoted by &rho;<span class="su">1</span>, &rho;<span class="su">2</span>, their velocities of
diffusion by u<span class="su">1</span>, u<span class="su">2</span>,  and if their partial pressures are p<span class="su">1</span>, p<span class="su">2</span>,  we have by
Boyle&rsquo;s law p<span class="su">1</span> = k<span class="su">1</span>&rho;<span class="su">1</span>, p<span class="su">2</span> = k<span class="su">2</span>&rho;<span class="su">2</span>, where k<span class="su">1</span>,k<span class="su">2</span> are constants for the two
gases, the temperature being constant. The axis of the cylinder is
taken as the axis of x.</p>

<p>From the considerations of the preceding section, the effects of
inertia of the diffusing gases may be neglected, and at any instant of
the process either of the gases is to be treated as kept in equilibrium
by its partial pressure and the resistance to diffusion produced by
the other gas. Calling this resistance per unit volume R, and putting
R = C&rho;<span class="su">1</span>&rho;<span class="su">2</span>(u<span class="su">1</span> &minus; u<span class="su">2</span>), where C is the coefficient of resistance, the equations
of equilibrium give</p>

<p class="noind">exactly as in the case of diffusion through a solid.</p>

<p>If we attempt to treat diffusion in liquids by a similar method,
it is, in the first place, necessary to define the &ldquo;partial pressure&rdquo;
of the components occurring in a liquid mixture. This leads to
the conception of &ldquo;osmotic pressure,&rdquo; which is dealt with in the
article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Solution</a></span>. For dilute solutions at constant temperature,
the assumption that the osmotic pressure is proportional to the
density, leads to results agreeing fairly closely with experience,
and this fact may be represented by the statement that a substance
occurring in a dilute solution behaves like a perfect gas.</p>

<p>6. <i>Relation of the Coefficient of Diffusion to the Units of Length
and Time.</i>&mdash;We may write the equation defining K in the form</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr><td rowspan="2">&minus;K ×</td> <td>I</td> <td>d&rho;</td>
<td rowspan="2">.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ov">&rho;</td> <td class="ov">dx</td></tr></table>

<p>Here &minus;d&rho;/&rho;dx represents the &ldquo;percentage rate&rdquo; at which the
density decreases with the distance x; and we thus see that the
coefficient of diffusion represents the ratio of the velocity of flow
to the percentage rate at which the density decreases with the
distance measured in the direction of flow. This percentage rate
being of the nature of a number divided by a length, and the
velocity being of the nature of a length divided by a time, we may
state that K is of two dimensions in length and &minus;1 in time, <i>i.e.</i>
dimensions L²/T.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Example 1.</i> Taking K = 0.1423 for carbon dioxide and air (at
temperature 0° C. and pressure 76 cm. of mercury) referred to a
centimetre and a second as units, we may interpret the result as
follows:&mdash;Supposing in a mixture of carbon dioxide and air, the
density of the carbon dioxide decreases by, say, 1, 2 or 3% of
itself in a distance of 1 cm., then the corresponding velocities
of the diffusing carbon dioxide will be respectively 0.01, 0.02 and
0.03 times 0.1423, that is, 0.001423, 0.002846 and 0.004269 cm.
per second in the three cases.</p>

<p><i>Example 2.</i> If we wished to take a foot and a second as our units,
we should have to divide the value of the coefficient of diffusion in
Example 1 by the square of the number of centimetres in 1 ft., that
is, roughly speaking, by 900, giving the new value of K = 0.00016
roughly.</p>
</div>

<p>7. <i>Numerical Values of the Coefficient of Diffusion.</i>&mdash;The
table on p. 258 gives the values of the coefficient of diffusion of
several of the principal pairs of gases at a pressure of 76 cm. of
mercury, and also of a number of other substances. In the gases
the centimetre and second are taken as fundamental units, in
other cases the centimetre and day.</p>

<p>8. <i>Irreversible Changes accompanying Diffusion.</i>&mdash;The diffusion
of two gases at constant pressure and temperature is a good
example of an &ldquo;irreversible process.&rdquo; The gases always tend to
mix, never to separate. In order to separate the gases a change
must be effected in the external conditions to which the mixture
is subjected, either by liquefying one of the gases, or by separating
them by diffusion through a membrane, or by bringing other outside
influences to bear on them. In the case of liquids, electrolysis
affords a means of separating the constituents of a mixture.
Every such method involves some change taking place outside the
mixture, and this change may be regarded as a &ldquo;compensating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>258</span>
transformation.&rdquo; We thus have an instance of the property
that every irreversible change leaves an indelible imprint somewhere
or other on the progress of events in the universe. That
the process of diffusion obeys the laws of irreversible thermodynamics
(if these laws are properly stated) is proved by the fact
that the compensating transformations required to separate
mixed gases do not essentially involve anything but transformation
of energy. The process of allowing gases to mix by diffusion,
and then separating them by a compensating transformation,
thus constitutes an irreversible cycle, the outside effects of which
are that energy somewhere or other must be less capable of transformation
than it was before the change. We express this fact by
stating that an irreversible process essentially implies a loss of
availability. To measure this loss we make use of the laws of
thermodynamics, and in particular of Lord Kelvin&rsquo;s statement
that &ldquo;It is impossible by means of inanimate material agency to
derive mechanical effect from any portion of matter by cooling it
below the temperature of the coldest of the surrounding objects.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Let us now assume that we have any syste m such as the gases
above considered, and that it is in the  presence of an indefinitely
extended medium which we shall call the  &ldquo;auxiliary medium.&rdquo; If
heat be taken from any part of the system, only part of this heat can
be converted into work by means of thermodynamic engines; and
the rest will be given to the auxiliary medium, and will constitute
unavailable energy or waste. To understand what this means, we
may consider the case of a condensing steam engine. Only part of
the energy liberated by the combustion of the coal is available for
driving the engine, the rest takes the form of heat imparted to
the condenser. The colder the condenser the more efficient is the
engine, and the smaller is the quantity of waste.</p>

<p>The amount of unavailable energy associated with any given
transformation is proportional to the absolute temperature of the
auxiliary medium. When divided by that temperature the quotient
is called the change of &ldquo;entropy&rdquo; associated with the given change
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Thermodynamics</a></span>). Thus if a body at temperature T receives
a quantity of heat Q, and if T<span class="su">0</span> is the temperature of the auxiliary
medium, the quantity of work which could be obtained from Q by
means of ideal thermodynamic engines would be Q(1 &minus; T<span class="su">0</span>/T), and
the balance, which is QT<span class="su">0</span>/T, would take the form of unavailable
or waste energy given to the medium. The quotient of this, when
divided by T<span class="su">0</span>, is Q/T, and this represents the quantity of entropy
associated with Q units of heat at temperature T.</p>

<p>Any irreversible change for which a compensating transformation
of energy exists represents, therefore, an increase of unavailable
energy, which is measurable in terms of entropy. The increase of
entropy is independent of the temperature of the auxiliary medium.
It thus affords a measure of the extent to which energy has run
to waste during the change. Moreover, when a body is heated, the
increase of entropy is the factor which determines how much of the
energy imparted to the body is unavailable for conversion into work
under given conditions. In all cases we have</p>

<p>When diffusion takes place between two gases inside a closed
vessel at uniform pressure and temperature no energy in the form
of heat or work is received from without, and hence the entropy
gained by the gases from without is zero. But the irreversible
processes inside the vessel may involve a gain of entropy, and this
can only be estimated by examining
by what means mixed
gases can be separated, and, in
particular, under what conditions
the process of mixing
and separating the gases could
(theoretically) be made reversible.</p>
</div>

<p>9. <i>Evidence derived from
Liquefaction of one or both of
the Gases.</i>&mdash;The gases in a
mixture can often be separated
by liquefying, or even solidifying,
one or both of the components.
In connexion with
this property we have the
important law according to
which &ldquo;The pressure of a
vapour in equilibrium with its
liquid depends only on the
temperature and is independent
of the pressures of any
other gases or vapours which
may be mixed with it.&rdquo; Thus
if two closed vessels be taken
containing some water and
one be exhausted, the other
containing air, and if the temperatures
be equal, evaporation
will go on until the
pressure of the vapour in the
exhausted vessel is equal to
its <i>partial</i> pressure in the other vessel, notwithstanding the fact
that the <i>total</i> pressure in the latter vessel is greater by the
pressure of the air.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>To separate mixed gases by liquefaction, they must be compressed
and cooled till one separates in the form of a liquid. If no changes are
to take place outside the system, the separate components must be
allowed to expand until the work of expansion is equal to the work
of compression, and the heat given out in compression is reabsorbed
in expansion. The process may be made as nearly reversible as we
like by performing the operations so slowly that the substances
are practically in a state of equilibrium at every stage. This is a
consequence of an important axiom in thermodynamics according
to which &ldquo;any small change in the neighbourhood of a state of
equilibrium is to a first approximation reversible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suppose now that at any stage of the compression the partial
pressures of the two gases are p<span class="su">1</span> and p<span class="su">2</span>, and that the volume is
changed from V to V &minus; dV. The work of compression is (p<span class="su">1</span> + p<span class="su">2</span>)dV,
and this work will be restored at the corresponding stage if each
of the separated gases increases in volume from V &minus; dV to V. The
ultimate state of the separated gases will thus be one in which
each gas occupies the volume V originally occupied by the mixture.</p>

<p>We may now obtain an estimate of the amount of energy rendered
unavailable by diffusion. We suppose two gases occupying volumes
V<span class="su">1</span> and V<span class="su">2</span> at equal pressure p to mix by diffusion, so that the final
volume is V<span class="su">1</span> + V<span class="su">2</span>. Then if before mixing each gas had been allowed
to expand till its volume was V<span class="su">1</span> + V<span class="su">2</span>, work would have been done
in the expansion, and the gases could still have been mixed by a
reversal of the process above described. In the actual diffusion this
work of expansion is lost, and represents energy rendered unavailable
at the temperature at which diffusion takes place. When divided
by that temperature the quotient gives the increase of entropy.
Thus the irreversible processes, and, in particular, the entropy
changes associated with diffusion of two gases at uniform pressure,
are the same as would take place if each of the gases in turn were to
expand by rushing into a vacuum, till it occupied the whole volume
of the mixture. A more rigorous proof involves considerations of
the thermodynamic potentials, following the methods of J. Willard
Gibbs (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Energetics</a></span>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>259</span></p>

<p>Another way in which two or more mixed gases can be separated
is by placing them in the presence of a liquid which can freely absorb
one of the gases, but in which the other gas or gases are insoluble.
Here again it is found by experience that when equilibrium exists
at a given temperature between the dissolved and undissolved
portions of the first gas, the partial pressure of that gas in the
mixture depends on the temperature alone, and is independent of
the partial pressures of the insoluble gases with which it is mixed,
so that the conclusions are the same as before.</p>
</div>

<p>10. <i>Diffusion through a Membrane or Partition. Theory of the
semi-permeable Membrane.</i>&mdash;It has been pointed out that diffusion
of gases frequently takes place in the interior of solids; moreover,
different gases behave differently with respect to the same solid at
the same temperature. A membrane or partition formed of such
a solid can therefore be used to effect a more or less complete
separation of gases from a mixture. This method is employed
commercially for extracting oxygen from the atmosphere, in
particular for use in projection lanterns where a high degree of
purity is not required. A similar method is often applied to
liquids and solutions and is known as &ldquo;dialysis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In such cases as can be tested experimentally it has been found
that a gas always tends to pass through a membrane from the side
where its density, and therefore its partial pressure, is greater
to the side where it is less; so that for equilibrium the partial
pressures on the two sides must be equal. This result is unaffected
by the presence of other gases on one or both sides of the
membrane. For example, if different gases at the same pressure
are separated by a partition through which one gas can pass more
rapidly than the other, the diffusion will give rise to a difference of
pressure on the two sides, which is capable of doing mechanical
work in moving the partition. In evidence of this conclusion
Max Planck quotes a test experiment made by him in the Physical
Institute of the university of Munich in 1883, depending on the
fact that platinum foil at white heat is permeable to hydrogen but
impermeable to air, so that if a platinum tube filled with hydrogen
be heated the hydrogen will diffuse out, leaving a vacuum.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The details of the experiment may be quoted here:&mdash;&ldquo;A glass
tube of about 5 mm. internal diameter, blown out to a bulb at the
middle, was provided with a stop-cock at one end. To the other a
platinum tube 10 cm. long was fastened, and closed at the end. The
whole tube was exhausted by a mercury pump, filled with hydrogen
at ordinary atmospheric pressure, and then closed. The closed end
of the platinum portion was then heated in a horizontal position by
a Bunsen burner. The connexion between the glass and platinum
tubes, having been made by means of sealing-wax, had to be kept
cool by a continuous current of water to prevent the softening of the
wax. After four hours the tube was taken from the flame, cooled
to the temperature of the room, and the stop-cock opened under
mercury. The mercury rose rapidly, almost completely filling the
tube, proving that the tube had been very nearly exhausted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In order that diffusion through a membrane may be reversible
so far as a particular gas is concerned, the process must take place
so slowly that equilibrium is set up at every stage (see § 9 above).
In order to separate one
gas from another consistently
with this condition
it is necessary
that no diffusion of the
latter gas should accompany
the process.
The name &ldquo;semi-permeable&rdquo;
is applied to
an ideal membrane or partition through which one gas can
pass, and which offers an insuperable barrier to any diffusion
whatever of a second gas. By means of two semi-permeable
partitions acting oppositely with respect to two different gases
A and B these gases could be mixed or separated by reversible
methods. The annexed figure shows a diagrammatic representation
of the process.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>We suppose the gases contained in a cylindrical tube; P, Q, R, S
are four pistons, of which P and R are joined to one connecting rod,
Q and S to another. P, S are impermeable to both gases; Q is
semi-permeable, allowing the gas A to pass through but not B, similarly
R allows the gas B to pass through but not A. The distance PR
is equal to the distance QS, so that if the rods are pushed towards each
other as far as they will go, P and Q will be in contact, as also R and
S. Imagine the space RQ filled with a mixture of the two gases
under these conditions. Then by slowly drawing the connecting
rods apart until R, Q touch, the gas A will pass into the space PQ,
and B will pass into the space RS, and the gases will finally be completely
separated; similarly, by pushing the connecting rods together,
the two gases will be remixed in the space RQ. By performing the
operations slowly enough we may make the processes as nearly
reversible as we please, so that no available energy is lost in either
change. The gas A being at every instant in equilibrium on the two
sides of the piston Q, its density, and therefore its partial pressure,
is the same on both sides, and the same is true regarding the gas B
on the two sides of R. Also <i>no work is done in moving the pistons</i>, for
the partial pressures of B on the two sides of R balance each other,
consequently, the resultant thrust on R is due to the gas A alone,
and is equal and opposite to its resultant thrust on P, so that the
connecting rods are at every instant in a state of mechanical equilibrium
so far as the pressures of the gases A and B are concerned. We
conclude that in the reversible separation of the gases by this method
at constant temperature without the production or absorption of
mechanical work, the densities and the partial pressures of the two
separated gases are the same as they were in the mixture. These
conclusions are in entire agreement with those of the preceding
section. If this agreement did not exist it would be possible, theoretically,
to obtain perpetual motion from the gases in a way that
would be inconsistent with the second law of thermodynamics.</p>
</div>

<p>Most physicists admit, as Planck does, that it is impossible to
obtain an ideal semi-permeable substance; indeed such a substance
would necessarily have to possess an infinitely great resistance
to diffusion for such gases as could not penetrate it. But in
an experiment performed under actual conditions the losses of
available energy arising from this cause would be attributable
to the imperfect efficiency of the partitions and not to the gases
themselves; moreover, these losses are, in every case, found to be
completely in accordance with the laws of irreversible thermodynamics.
The reasoning in this article being somewhat condensed
the reader must necessarily be referred to treatises on
thermodynamics for further information on points of detail
connected with the argument. Even when he consults these
treatises he may find some points omitted which have been
examined in full detail at some time or other, but are not sufficiently
often raised to require mention in print.</p>

<p>II. <i>Kinetic Models of Diffusion.</i>&mdash;Imagine in the first instance
that a very large number of red balls are distributed over one half
of a billiard table, and an equal number of white balls over the
other half. If the balls are set in motion with different velocities
in various directions, diffusion will take place, the red balls finding
their way among the white ones, and vice versa; and the
process will be retarded by collisions between the balls. The
simplest model of a perfect gas studied in the kinetic theory of
gases (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Molecule</a></span>) differs from the above illustration in that
the bodies representing the molecules move in space instead of in
a plane, and, unlike billiard balls, their motion is unresisted,
and they are perfectly elastic, so that no kinetic energy is lost
either during their free motions, or at a collision.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The mathematical analysis connected with the application of the
kinetic theory to diffusion is very long and cumbersome. We shall
therefore confine our attention to regarding a medium formed of
elastic spheres as a mechanical model, by which the most important
features of diffusion can be illustrated. We shall assume the results
of the kinetic theory, according to which:&mdash;(1) In a dynamical
model of a perfect gas the mean kinetic energy of translation of the
molecules represents the absolute temperature of the gas. (2) The
pressure at any point is proportional to the product of the number
of molecules in unit volume about that point into the mean square
of the velocity. (The mean square of the velocity is different from
but proportional to the square of the mean velocity, and in the
subsequent arguments either of these two quantities can generally
be taken.) (3) In a gas mixture represented by a mixture of molecules
of unequal masses, the mean kinetic energies of the different
kinds are equal.</p>

<p>Consider now the problem of diffusion in a region containing two
kinds of molecules A and B of unequal mass. The molecules of A
in the neighbourhood of any point will, by their motion, spread out
in every direction until they come into collision with other molecules
of either kind, and this spreading out from every point of the medium
will give rise to diffusion. If we imagine the velocities of the A
molecules to be equally distributed in all directions, as they would
be in a homogeneous mixture, it is obvious that the process of diffusion
will be greater, <i>ceteris paribus</i>, the greater the velocity of the molecules,
and the greater the length of the free path before a collision
takes place. If we assume consistently with this, that the coefficient
of diffusion of the gas A is proportional to the mean value of
W{a}l{a}, where w{a} is the velocity and l{a} is the length of the path of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>260</span>
molecule of A, this expression for the coefficient of diffusion is of the
right dimensions in length and time. If, moreover, we observe that
when diffusion takes place in a fixed direction, say that of the axis
of x, it depends only on the resolved part of the velocity and length
of path in that direction: this hypothesis readily leads to our taking
the mean value of <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>w<span class="su">a</span>l<span class="su">a</span> as the coefficient of diffusion for the gas A.
This value was obtained by O. E. Meyer and others.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, it makes the coefficients of diffusion
unequal for the two gases, a result inconsistent with that obtained
above from considerations of the coefficient of resistance, and
leading to the consequence that differences of pressure would be
set up in different parts of the gas. To equalize these differences of
pressure, Meyer assumed that a counter current is set up, this current
being, of course, very slow in practice; and J. Stefan assumed that
the diffusion of one gas was not affected by collisions between molecules
of the <i>same gas</i>. When the molecules are mixed in equal
proportions both hypotheses lead to the value <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">6</span>([w<span class="su">a</span>l<span class="su">a</span>] + [w<span class="su">b</span>l<span class="su">b</span>]),
(square brackets denoting mean values). When one gas preponderates
largely over the other, the phenomena of diffusion are too
difficult of observation to allow of accurate experimental tests
being made. Moreover, in this case no difference exists unless the
molecules are different in size or mass.</p>

<p>Instead of supposing a velocity of translation added after the
mathematical calculations have been performed, a better plan is to
assume from the outset that the molecules of the two gases have
small velocities of translation in opposite directions, superposed on
the distribution of velocity, which would occur in a medium representing
a gas at rest. When a collision occurs between molecules
of different gases a transference of momentum takes place between
them, and the quantity of momentum so transferred in one second
in a unit of volume gives a dynamical measure of the resistance to
diffusion. It is to be observed that, however small the relative
velocity of the gases A and B, it plays an all-important part in
determining the coefficient of resistance; for without such relative
motion, and with the velocities evenly distributed in all directions, no
transference of momentum could take place. The coefficient of
resistance being found, the motion of each of the two gases may be
discussed separately.</p>
</div>

<p>One of the most important consequences of the kinetic theory
is that if the volume be kept constant the coefficient of diffusion
varies as the square root of the absolute temperature. To prove
this, we merely have to imagine the velocity of each molecule to
be suddenly increased n fold; the subsequent processes, including
diffusion, will then go on n times as fast; and the temperature
T, being proportional to the kinetic energy, and therefore to the
square of the velocity, will be increased n² fold. Thus K, the
coefficient of diffusion, varies as &radic;T.</p>

<p>The relation of K to the density when the temperature remains
constant is more difficult to discuss, but it may be sufficient to
notice that if the number of molecules is increased n fold, the
chances of a collision are n times as great, and the distance
traversed between collisions is (not <i>therefore</i> but as the result of
more detailed reasoning) on the average 1/n of what it was before.
Thus the free path, and therefore the coefficient of diffusion,
varies inversely as the density, or directly as the volume. If the
pressure p and temperature T be taken as variables, K varies
inversely as p and directly as &radic;T³.</p>

<p>Now according to the experiments first made by J. C. Maxwell
and J. Loschmidt, it appeared that with constant density K
was proportional to T more nearly than to &radic;T. The inference is
that in this respect a medium formed of colliding spheres fails to
give a correct mechanical model of gases. It has been found by
L. Boltzmann, Maxwell and others that a system of particles
whose mutual actions vary according to the inverse fifth power of
the distance between them represents more correctly the relation
between the coefficient of diffusion and temperature in actual
gases. Other recent theories of diffusion have been advanced
by M. Thiesen, P. Langevin and W. Sutherland. On the other
hand, J. Thovert finds experimental evidence that the coefficient
of diffusion <i>is</i> proportional to molecular velocity in the cases
examined of non-electrolytes dissolved in water at 18° at 2.5
grams per litre.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Bibliography.</span>&mdash;The best introduction to the study of theories
of diffusion is afforded by O. E. Meyer&rsquo;s Kinetic <i>Theory of Gases</i>,
translated by Robert E. Baynes (London, 1899). The mathematical
portion, though sufficient for ordinary purposes, is mostly of the
simplest possible character. Another useful treatise is R. Ruhlmann&rsquo;s

<p><span class="bold">DIGBY, SIR EVERARD<a name="ar86" id="ar86"></a></span> (1578-1606), English conspirator, son
of Everard Digby of Stoke Dry, Rutland, was born on the 16th
of May 1578. He inherited a large estate at his father&rsquo;s death
in 1592, and acquired a considerable increase by his marriage in
1596 to Mary, daughter and heir of William Mulsho of Gothurst
(now Gayhurst), in Buckinghamshire. He obtained a place in
Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s household and as a ward of the crown was
brought up a Protestant; but about 1599 he came under the
influence of the Jesuit, John Gerard, and soon afterwards joined
the Roman Catholics. He supported James&rsquo;s accession and was
knighted by the latter on the 23rd of April 1603. In a letter to
Salisbury, the date of which has been ascribed to May 1605,
Digby offered to go on a mission to the pope to obtain from
the latter a promise to prevent Romanist attempts against the
government in return for concessions to the Roman Catholics;
adding that if severe measures were again taken against them
&ldquo;within brief there will be massacres, rebellions and desperate
attempts against the king and state.&rdquo; Digby had suffered no
personal injury or persecution on account of his religion, but he
sympathized with his co-religionists; and when at Michaelmas,
1605, the government had fully decided to return to the policy of
repression, the authors of the Gunpowder Plot (<i>q.v.</i>) sought his
financial support, and he joined eagerly in the conspiracy. His
particular share in the plan was the organization of a rising in the
Midlands; and on the pretence of a hunting party he assembled a
body of gentlemen together at Danchurch in Warwickshire on the
5th of November, who were to take action immediately the news
arrived from London of the successful destruction of the king
and the House of Lords, and to seize the person of the princess
Elizabeth, who was residing in the neighbourhood. The conspirators
arrived late on the evening of the 6th to tell their story
of failure and disaster, and Digby, who possibly might have
escaped the more serious charge of high treason, was persuaded by
Catesby, with a false tale that the king and Salisbury were dead,
to further implicate himself in the plot and join the small band of
conspirators in their hopeless endeavour to raise the country. He
accompanied them, the same day, to Huddington in Worcestershire
and on the 7th to Holbeche in Staffordshire. The following
morning, however, he abandoned his companions, dismissed his
servants except two, who declared &ldquo;they would never leave him
but against their will,&rdquo; and attempted with these to conceal himself
in a pit. He was, however, soon discovered and surrounded.
He made a last effort to break through his captors on horseback,
but was taken and conveyed a prisoner to the Tower. His trial
took place in Westminster Hall, on the 27th of January 1606, and
alone among the conspirators he pleaded guilty, declaring that
the motives of his crime had been his friendship for Catesby
and his devotion to his religion. He was condemned to death,
and his execution, which took place on the 31st, in St Paul&rsquo;s
Churchyard, was accompanied by all the brutalities exacted by
the law.</p>

<p>Digby was a handsome man, of fine presence. Father Gerard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>261</span>
extols his skill in sport, his &ldquo;riding of great horses,&rdquo; as well as his
skill in music, his gifts of mind and his religious devotion, and
concludes &ldquo;he was as complete a man in all things, that deserved
estimation or might win affection as one should see in a kingdom.&rdquo;
Some of Digby&rsquo;s letters and papers, which include a poem
before his execution, a last letter to his infant sons and correspondence
with his wife from the Tower, were published in <i>The
Gunpowder Treason</i> by Thomas Barlow, bishop of Lincoln, in
1679. He left two sons, of whom the elder, Sir Kenelm Digby,
was the well-known author and diplomatist.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIGBY, SIR KENELM<a name="ar87" id="ar87"></a></span> (1603-1665), English author, diplomatist
and naval commander, son of Sir Everard Digby (<i>q.v.</i>),
was born on the 11th of July 1603, and after his father&rsquo;s execution
in 1606 resided with his mother at Gayhurst, being brought up
apparently as a Roman Catholic. In 1617 he accompanied his
cousin, Sir John Digby, afterwards 1st earl of Bristol, and then
ambassador in Spain, to Madrid. On his return in April 1618 he
entered Gloucester Hall (now Worcester College), Oxford, and
studied under Thomas Allen (1542-1632), the celebrated mathematician,
who was much impressed with his abilities and called
him the <i>Mirandula</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the infant prodigy, of his age.<a name="fa1h" id="fa1h" href="#ft1h"><span class="sp">1</span></a> He left
the university without taking a degree in 1620, and travelled
in France, where, according to his own account, he inspired an
uncontrollable passion in the queen-mother, Marie de&rsquo; Medici,
now a lady of more than mature age and charms; he visited
Florence, and in March 1623 joined Sir John Digby again at
Madrid, at the time when Prince Charles and Buckingham arrived
on their adventurous expedition. He joined the prince&rsquo;s household
and returned with him to England on the 5th of October
1623, being knighted by James I. on the 23rd of October and
receiving the appointment of gentleman of the privy chamber to
Prince Charles. In 1625 he married secretly Venetia, daughter of
Sir Edward Hanley of Tonge Castle, Shropshire, a lady of extraordinary
beauty and intellectual attainments, but of doubtful
virtue. Digby was a man of great stature and bodily strength.
Edward Hyde, afterwards earl of Clarendon, who with Ben
Jonson was included among his most intimate friends, describes
him as &ldquo;a man of very extraordinary person and presence which
drew the eyes of all men upon him, a wonderful graceful
behaviour, a flowing courtesy and civility, and such a volubility
of language as surprised and delighted.&rdquo;<a name="fa2h" id="fa2h" href="#ft2h"><span class="sp">2</span></a> Digby for some time
was excluded from public employment by Buckingham&rsquo;s jealousy
of his cousin, Lord Bristol. At length in 1627, on the latter&rsquo;s
advice, Digby determined to attempt &ldquo;some generous action,&rdquo;
and on the 22nd of December, with the approval of the king,
embarked as a privateer with two ships, with the object of attacking
the French ships in the Venetian harbour of Scanderoon. On
the 18th of January he arrived off Gibraltar and captured several
Spanish and Flemish vessels. From the 15th of February to the
27th of March he remained at anchor off Algiers on account of the
sickness of his men, and extracted a promise from the authorities
of better treatment of the English ships. He seized a rich Dutch
vessel near Majorca, and after other adventures gained a complete
victory over the French and Venetian ships in the harbour of
Scanderoon on the 11th of June. His successes, however, brought
upon the English merchants the risk of reprisals, and he was urged
to depart. He returned home in triumph in February 1629, and
was well received by the king, and was made a commissioner of
the navy in October 1630, but his proceedings were disavowed on
account of the complaints of the Venetian ambassador. In 1633
Lady Digby died, and her memory was celebrated by Ben Jonson
in a series of poems entitled <i>Eupheme</i>, and by other poets of
the day. Digby retired to Gresham College, and exhibited extravagant
grief, maintaining a seclusion for two years. About
this time Digby professed himself a Protestant, but by October
1635, while in France, he had already returned to the Roman
Catholic faith.<a name="fa3h" id="fa3h" href="#ft3h"><span class="sp">3</span></a> In a letter dated the 27th of March 1636 Laud
remonstrates with him, but assures him of the continuance of his
friendship.<a name="fa4h" id="fa4h" href="#ft4h"><span class="sp">4</span></a> In 1638 he published <i>A Conference with a Lady about
choice of a Religion</i>, in which he argues that the Roman Church,
possessing alone the qualifications of universality, unity of
doctrine and uninterrupted apostolic succession, is the only true
church, and that the intrusion of error into it is impossible. The
same subject is treated in letters to George Digby, afterwards
2nd earl of Bristol, dated the 2nd of November 1638 and the 29th
of November 1639, which were published in 1651, as well as in
a further <i>Discourse concerning Infallibility in Religion</i> in 1652.
Returning to England he associated himself with the queen and
her Roman Catholic friends, and joined in the appeal to the
English Romanists for money to support the king&rsquo;s Scottish
expedition.<a name="fa5h" id="fa5h" href="#ft5h"><span class="sp">5</span></a> In consequence he was summoned to the bar of
the House of Commons on the 27th of January 1641, and the
king was petitioned to remove him with other recusants from his
councils. He left England, and while at Paris killed in a duel a
French lord who had insulted Charles I. in his presence. Louis
XIII. took his part, and furnished him with a military escort into
Flanders. Returning home he was imprisoned, by order of the
House of Commons, early in 1642, successively in the &ldquo;Three
Tobacco Pipes nigh Charing Cross,&rdquo; where his delightful conversation
is said to have transformed the prison into &ldquo;a place of
delight,&rdquo;<a name="fa6h" id="fa6h" href="#ft6h"><span class="sp">6</span></a> and at Winchester House. He was finally released and
allowed to go to France on the 30th of July 1643, through the
intervention of the queen of France, Anne of Austria, on condition
that he would neither promote nor conceal any plots abroad
against the English government.</p>

<p>Before leaving England an attempt was made to draw from
him an admission that Laud, with whom he had been intimate,
had desired to be made a cardinal, but Digby denied that the
archbishop had any leanings towards Rome. On the 1st of
November 1643 it was resolved by the Commons to confiscate his
property. He published in London the same year <i>Observations
on the 22nd stanza in the 9th canto of the 2nd book of Spenser&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Faërie Queene,&rdquo;</i> the MS. of which is in the Egerton collection
(British Museum, No. 2725 f. 117 b), and <i>Observations</i> on a
surreptitious and unauthorized edition of the <i>Religio Medici</i>, by
Sir Thomas Browne, from the Roman Catholic point of view,
which drew a severe rebuke from the author. After his arrival
in Paris he published his chief philosophical works, <i>Of Bodies</i>
and <i>Of the Immortality of Man&rsquo;s Soul</i> (1644), autograph MSS. of
which are in the Bibliothèque Ste Geneviève at Paris, and made
the acquaintance of Descartes. He was appointed by Queen
Henrietta Maria her chancellor, and in the summer of 1645 he was
despatched by her to Rome to obtain assistance. Digby promised
the conversion of Charles and of his chief supporters. At first his
eloquence made a great impression. Pope Innocent X. declared
that he spoke not merely as a Catholic but as an ecclesiastic.
But the absence of any warrant from Charles himself roused
suspicions as to the solidity of his assurances, and he obtained
nothing but a grant of 20,000 crowns. A violent quarrel with the
pope followed, and he returned in 1646, having consented in the
queen&rsquo;s name to complete religious freedom for the Roman
Catholics, both in England and Ireland, to an independent parliament
in Ireland, and to the surrender of Dublin and all the Irish
fortresses into the hands of the Roman Catholics, the king&rsquo;s
troops to be employed in enforcing the articles and the pope
granting about £36,000 with a promise of further payments in
obtaining direct assistance. In February 1649 Digby was invited
to come to England to arrange a proposed toleration of the Roman
Catholics, but on his arrival in May the scheme had already been
abandoned. He was again banished on the 31st of August, and
it was not till 1654 that he was allowed by the council of state to
return. He now entered into close relations with Cromwell, from
whom he hoped to obtain toleration for the Roman Catholics, and
whose alliance he desired to secure for France rather than for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>262</span>
Spain, and was engaged by Cromwell, much to the scandal of both
Royalists and Roundheads, in negotiations abroad, of which the
aim was probably to prevent a union between those two foreign
powers. He visited Germany, in 1660 was in Paris, and at the
Restoration returned to England. He was well received in spite
of his former relations with Cromwell, and was confirmed in his
post as Queen Henrietta Maria&rsquo;s chancellor. In January 1661
he delivered a lecture, which was published the same month, at
Gresham College, on the vegetation of plants, and became an
original member of the Royal Society in 1663. In January 1664
he was forbidden to appear at court, the cause assigned being that
he had interposed too far in favour of the 2nd earl of Bristol,
disgraced by the king on account of the charge of high treason
brought by him against Clarendon into the House of Lords. The
rest of his life was spent in the enjoyment of literary and scientific
society at his house in Covent Garden. He died on the 11th of
June 1665. He had five children, of whom two, a son and one
daughter, survived him.</p>

<p>Digby, though he possessed for the time a considerable knowledge
of natural science, and is said to have been the first to
explain the necessity of oxygen to the existence of plants, bears
no high place in the history of science. He was a firm believer in
astrology and alchemy, and the extraordinary fables which he
circulated on the subject of his discoveries are evidence of anything
rather than of the scientific spirit. In 1656 he made public
a marvellous account of a city in Tripoli, petrified in a few hours,
which he printed in the <i>Mercurius Politicus</i>. Malicious reports
had been current that his wife had been poisoned by one of his
prescriptions, viper wine, taken to preserve her beauty. Evelyn,
who visited him in Paris in 1651, describes him as an &ldquo;errant
mountebank.&rdquo; Henry Stubbes characterizes him as &ldquo;the very
Pliny of our age for lying,&rdquo; and Lady Fanshawe refers to the same
&ldquo;infirmity.&rdquo;<a name="fa7h" id="fa7h" href="#ft7h"><span class="sp">7</span></a> His famous &ldquo;powder of sympathy,&rdquo; which seems
to have been only powder of &ldquo;vitriol,&rdquo; healed without any
contact, by being merely applied to a rag or bandage taken from
the wound, and Digby records a miraculous cure by this means in
a lecture given by him at Montpellier on this subject in 1658,
published in French and English the same year, in German in
1660 and in Dutch in 1663; but Digby&rsquo;s claim to its original
discovery is doubtful, Nathaniel Highmore in his <i>History of
Generation</i> (1651, p. 113) calling the powder &ldquo;Talbot&rsquo;s powder,&rdquo;
and ascribing its invention to Sir Gilbert Talbot. Some of Digby&rsquo;s
pills and preparations, however, described in <i>The Closet of the
Eminently Learned Sir Kenelm Digby Knt. Opened</i> (publ. 1677),
are said to make less demand upon the faith of patients, and his
injunction on the subject of the making of tea, to let the water
&ldquo;remain upon it no longer than you can say the Miserere Psalm
very leisurely,&rdquo; is one by no means to be ridiculed. As a philosopher
and an Aristotelian Digby shows little originality and
followed the methods of the schoolmen. His Roman Catholic
orthodoxy mixed with rationalism, and his political opinions,
according to which any existing authority should receive support,
were evidently derived from Thomas White (1582-1676), the
Roman Catholic philosopher, who lived with him in France.
White published in 1651 <i>Institutionum Peripateticorum libri
quinque</i>, purporting to expound Digby&rsquo;s &ldquo;peripatetic philosophy,&rdquo;
but going far beyond Digby&rsquo;s published treatises.
Digby&rsquo;s <i>Memoirs</i> are composed in the high-flown fantastic manner
then usual when recounting incidents of love and adventure,
but the style of his more sober works is excellent. In 1632 he
presented to the Bodleian library a collection of 236 MSS., bequeathed
to him by his former tutor Thomas Allen, and described
in <i>Catalogi codicum manuscriptorum bibliothecae Bodleianae</i>, by
W. D. Macray, part ix. Besides the works already mentioned
Digby translated <i>A Treatise of adhering to God written by Albert
the Great, Bishop of Ratisbon</i> (1653); and he was the author of
<i>Private Memoirs</i>, published by Sir N. H. Nicholas from <i>Harleian
MS. 6758</i> with introduction (1827); <i>Journal of the Scanderoon
Voyage in 1628</i>, printed by J. Bruce with preface (Camden
Society, 1868); <i>Poems from Sir Kenelm Digby&rsquo;s Papers</i>... with
preface and notes (Roxburghe Club, 1877); in the <i>Add. MSS.</i>
34,362 f. 66 is a poem <i>Of the Miserys of Man</i>, probably by Digby;
<i>Choice of Experimental Receipts in Physick and Chirurgery</i> ...
<i>collected by Sir K. Digby</i> (1668), and <i>Chymical Secrets and Rare
Experiments</i> (1683), were published by G. Hartman, who describes
himself as Digby&rsquo;s steward and laboratory assistant.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIGBY, KENELM HENRY<a name="ar88" id="ar88"></a></span> (1800-1880), English writer,
youngest son of William Digby, dean of Clonfert, was born at
Clonfert, Ireland, in 1800. He was educated at Trinity College,
Cambridge, and soon after taking his B.A. degree there in 1819
became a Roman Catholic. He spent most of his life, which was
mainly devoted to literary pursuits, in London, where he died on
the 22nd of March 1880. Digby&rsquo;s reputation rests chiefly on his
earliest publication, <i>The Broadstone of Honour, or Rules for the
Gentlemen of England</i> (1822), which contains an exhaustive survey
of medieval customs, full of quotations from varied sources. The
work was subsequently enlarged and issued (1826-1827) in four
volumes entitled: <i>Godefridus</i>, <i>Tancredus</i>, <i>Morus</i> and <i>Orlandus</i>
(numerous re-impressions, the best of which is the edition
brought out by B. Quaritch in five volumes, 1876-1877).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Among Digby&rsquo;s other works are: <i>Mores Catholici, or Ages of
Faith</i> (11 vols., London, 1831-1840); <i>Compitum; or the Meeting of
the Ways at the Catholic Church</i> (7 vols., London, 1848-1854); <i>The
Lovers&rsquo; Seat, Kathemérina; or Common Things in relation to Beauty,

<p><span class="bold">DIGENES ACRITAS, BASILIUS,<a name="ar89" id="ar89"></a></span> Byzantine national hero,
probably lived in the 10th century. He is named Digenes (of
double birth) as the son of a Moslem father and a Christian
mother; Acritas (<span class="grk" title="akra">&#7940;&#954;&#961;&#945;</span>, frontier, boundary), as one of the frontier
guards of the empire, corresponding to the Roman <i>milites
limitanei</i>. The chief duty of these <i>acritae</i> consisted in repelling
Moslem inroads and the raids of the <i>apelatae</i> (cattle-lifters),
brigands who may be compared with the more modern Klephts.
The original Digenes epic is lost, but four poems are extant, in
which the different incidents of the legend have been worked
up by different hands. The first of these consists of about 4000
lines, written in the so-called &ldquo;political&rdquo; metre, and was discovered
in the latter part of the 19th century, in a 16th-century
MS., at Trebizond; the other three MSS. were found at Grotta
Ferrata, Andros and Oxford. The poem, which has been compared
with the <i>Chanson de Roland</i> and the <i>Romance of the Cid</i>,
undoubtedly contains a kernel of fact, although it cannot be
regarded as in any sense an historical record. The scene of action
is laid in Cappadocia and the district of the Euphrates.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIGEST,<a name="ar90" id="ar90"></a></span> a term used generally of any digested or carefully
arranged collection or compendium of written matter, but more
particularly in law of a compilation in condensed form of a body
of law digested in a systematical method; <i>e.g.</i> the Digest (<i>Digesta</i>)
or Pandects (<span class="grk" title="Pandektai">&#928;&#940;&#957;&#948;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span>) of Justinian, a collection of extracts
from the earlier jurists compiled by order of the emperor
Justinian. The word is also given to the compilations of the
main points (marginal or hand-notes) of decided cases, usually

such titles as &ldquo;Common Law Digest,&rdquo; &ldquo;Annual Digest,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DIGESTIVE ORGANS<a name="ar91" id="ar91"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Pathology</span>). Several facts of importance
have to be borne in mind for a proper appreciation of
the pathology of the organs concerned in digestive processes (for
the anatomy see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Alimentary Canal</a></span> and allied articles). In
the first place, more than all other systems, the digestive comprises
greater range of structure and exhibits wider diversity of function
within its domain. Each separate structure and each different
function presents special pathological signs and symptoms.
Again, the duties imposed upon the system have to be performed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>263</span>
notwithstanding constant variations in the work set them. The
crude articles of diet offered them vary immensely in nature, bulk
and utility, from which they must elaborate simple food-elements
for absorption, incorporate them after absorption into complex
organic substances properly designed to supply the constant needs
of cellular activity, of growth and repair, and fitly harmonized
to fulfil the many requirements of very divergent processes and
functions. Any form of unphysiological diet, each failure to
cater for the wants of any special tissue engaged in, or of any
processes of, metabolism, carry with them pathological signs.
Perhaps in greater degree than elsewhere are the individual
sections of the digestive system dependent upon, and closely
correlated with, one another. The lungs can only yield oxygen
to the blood when the oxygen is uncombined; no compounds
are of use. The digestive organs have to deal with an enormous
variety of compound bodies, from which to obtain the elements
necessary for protoplasmic upkeep and activity. Morbid lesions
of the respiratory and circulatory systems are frequently capable
of compensation through increased activity elsewhere, and the
symptoms they give rise to follow chiefly along one line; diseases
of the digestive organs are more liable to occasion disorders
elsewhere than to excite compensatory actions. The digestive
system includes every organ, function and process concerned
with the utilization of food-stuffs, from the moment of their
entrance into the mouth, their preparation in the canal, assimilation
with the tissues, their employment therein, up to their
excretion or expulsion in the form of waste. Each portion
resembles a link of a continuous chain; each link depends upon
the integrity of the others, the weakening or breaking of one
straining or making impotent the chain as a whole.</p>

<p>The mucous membrane lining the alimentary tract is the part
most subject to pathological alterations, and in this connexion
it should be remembered that this membrane differs both in
structure and functions throughout the tract. Chiefly protective
from the mouth to the cardia, it is secretory and absorbent in the
stomach and bowel; while the glandular cells forming part of it
secrete both acid and alkaline fluids, several ferments or mucus.
Over the dorsum of the tongue its modified cells subserve the
sense of taste. Without, connected with it by the submucous
connective tissue, is placed the muscular coat, and externally over
the greater portion of its length the peritoneal serous membrane.
All parts are supplied with blood-vessels, lymph-ducts and
nerves, the last belonging either to local or to central circuits.
Associated with the tract are the salivary glands, the liver and
the pancreas; while, in addition, lymphoid tissue is met with
diffusely scattered throughout the lining membranes in the tonsils,
appendix, solitary glands and Peyer&rsquo;s patches, and the mesenteric
glands. The functions of the various parts of the system in whose
lesions we are here interested are many in number, and can only
be summarized here. (For the physiology of digestion see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Nutrition</a></span>.) Broadly, they maybe given as: (1) Ingestion and
swallowing of food, transmission of it through the tract, and
expulsion of the waste material; (2) secretion of acids and
alkalis for the performance of digestive processes, aided by (3)
elaboration and addition of complex bodies, termed enzymes
or ferments; (4) secretion of mucus; (5) protection of the body
against organismal infection, and against toxic products; (6)
absorption of food elements and reconstitution of them into
complex substances fitted for metabolic application; and (7)
excretion of the waste products of protoplasmic action. These
functions may be altered by disease, singly or in conjunction; it
is rare, however, to find but one affected, while an apparently
identical disturbance of function may often arise from totally
different organic lesions. Another point of importance is seen in
the close interdependence which exists between the secretions of
acid and those of alkaline reaction. The difference in reaction
seems to act <i>mutatis mutandis</i> as a stimulant in each instance.</p>

<p class="center pt1"><i>General Diseases.</i></p>

<p>In all sections of the alimentary canal actively engaged in the
digestion of food, a well-marked local engorgement of the blood-vessels
supplying the walls occurs. The hyperaemia abates soon
after completion of the special duties of the individual sections.
<span class="sidenote">Vascular lesions.</span>
This normal condition may be abnormally exaggerated by overstimulation
from irritant poisons introduced into the
canal; from too rich, too copious or indigestible
articles of diet; or from too prolonged an experience
of some unvaried kind of food-stuff, especially if large quantities
of it are necessary for metabolic needs; entering into the first
stage of inflammation, acute hyperaemia. More important,
because productive of less tractable lesions, is passive congestion
of the digestive organs. Whenever the flow of blood into the
right side of the heart is hindered, whether it arise from disease
of the heart itself, or of the lungs, or proceed from obstruction in
some part of the portal system, the damming-back of the venous
circulation speedily produces a more or less pronounced stasis of
the blood in the walls of the alimentary canal and in the associated
abdominal glands. The lack of a sufficiently vigorous flow of
blood is followed by deficient secretion of digestive agents from
the glandular elements involved, by decreased motility of the
muscular coats of the stomach and bowel, and lessened adaptability
throughout for dealing with even slight irregular demands
on their powers. The mucous membrane of the stomach and
bowel, less able to withstand the effects of irritation, even of a
minor character, readily passes into a condition of chronic
catarrh, while it frequently is the seat of small abrasions,
haemorrhagic erosions, which may cause vomiting of blood and
the appearance of blood in the stools. Obstruction to the flow
of blood from the liver leads to dilatation of its blood-vessels,
consequent pressure upon the hepatic cells adjoining them, and
their gradual loss of function, or even atrophy and degeneration.
In addition to the results of such passive congestion exhibited
by the stomach and bowel as noted above, passive congestion
of the liver is often accompanied by varicose enlargement of the
abdominal veins, in particular of those which surround the lower
end of the oesophagus, the lowest part of the rectum and anus.
In the latter position these dilated veins constitute what are
known as haemorrhoids or piles, internal or external as their
site lies within or outside the anal aperture.</p>

<p>The mucous and serous membranes of the canal and the
glandular elements of the associated organs are the parts most
subject to inflammatory affections. Among the several sections
of the digestive tract itself, the oesophagus and jejunum are
singularly exempt from inflammatory processes; the fauces,
stomach, caecum and appendix, ileum, mouth and duodenum
(including the opening of the common bile-duct), are more
commonly involved. <i>Stomatitis</i>, or inflammation of the mouth,
<span class="sidenote">Inflammatory lesions.</span>
has many predisposing factors, but it has now been
definitely determined that its exciting cause is always
some form of micro-organism. Any condition favouring
oral sepsis, as carious teeth, pyorrhoea alveolaris (a discharge
of pus due to inflamed granulations round carious teeth),
granulations beneath thick crusts of tartar, or an irritating tooth
plate, favours the growth of pyogenic organisms and hence of
stomatitis. Many varieties of this disease have been described,
but all are forms of &ldquo;pyogenic&rdquo; or &ldquo;septic stomatitis.&rdquo; This in
its mildest form is catarrhal or erythematous, and is attended
only by slight swelling tenderness and salivation. In its next
stage of acuteness it is known as &ldquo;membranous,&rdquo; as a false
membrane is produced somewhat resembling that due to
diphtheria, though caused by a staphylococcus only. A still
more acute form is &ldquo;ulcerative,&rdquo; which may go on to the formation
of an abscess beneath the tongue. Scarlet fever usually
gives rise to a slight inflammation of the mouth followed by
desquamation, but more rarely it is accompanied by a most
severe oedematous stomatitis with glossitis and tonsillitis.
Erysipelas on the face may infect the mouth, and an acute
stomatitis due to the diphtheria bacillus, Klebs-Loeffler bacillus,
has been described. A distinct and very dangerous form of
stomatitis in infants and young children is known as &ldquo;aphthous
stomatitis&rdquo; or &ldquo;thrush.&rdquo; This is caused by the growth of
<i>Oidium albicans</i>. It is always preceded by a gastro-enteritis and
dry mouth, and if this is not attended to, soon attracts attention
by the little white raised patches surrounded by a dusky red zone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>264</span>
scattered on tongue and cheeks. Epidemics have occurred in
hospitals and orphanages. Mouth breathing is the cause of many
ills. As a result of this, the mucous membrane of the tongue, &amp;c.,
becomes dry, micro-organisms multiply and the mouth becomes
foul. Also from disease of the nose, the upper jaw, palate and
teeth do not make proper progress in development. There is
overgrowth of tonsils, and adenoids, with resulting deafness, and
the child&rsquo;s mental development suffers. An ordinary &ldquo;sore
throat&rdquo; usually signifies acute catarrh of the fauces, and is of
purely organismal origin, &ldquo;catching cold&rdquo; being only a secondary
and minor cause. In &ldquo;relaxed throats&rdquo; there is a chronic
catarrhal state of the lining membrane, with some passive congestion.
The tonsils are peculiarly liable to catarrhal attacks,
as might a priori be expected by reason of their Cerberus-like
function with regard to bacterial intruders. Still, acute attacks
of tonsillitis appear on good evidence to be more common among
individuals predisposed constitutionally to rheumatic manifestations.
Cases of acute tonsillitis may or may not go on to suppuration
or quinsy; in all there is great congestion of the glands,
increased mucus secretion, and often secondary involvement of
the lymphatic glands of the neck. Repeated acute attacks often
lead to chronic inflammation, in which the glands are enlarged,
and often hypertrophied in the true sense of the term. The
oesophagus is the seat of inflammation but seldom. In infants
and young children thrush due to <i>Oidium albicans</i> may spread
from the mouth, and also a diphtheritic inflammation spreads
from the fauces into the oesophagus. A catarrhal oesophagitis
is rarely seen, but the commonest form is traumatic, due to the
swallowing of boiling water, corrosive or irritant substances, &amp;c.
A non-malignant ulceration may result which later leads on to
an oesophageal stricture. The physical changes presented by the
coats of the stomach and the intestine, the subjects of catarrhal
attacks, closely resemble one another, but differ symptomatically.
Acute catarrh of the stomach is associated with intense
hyperaemia of its lining coats, with visible engorgement and
swelling of the mucous membrane, and an excessive secretion of
mucus. The formation of active gastric juice is arrested, digestion
ceases, peristaltic movements are sluggish or absent, unless so
over-stimulated that they act in a direction the reverse of the
normal, and induce expulsion of the gastric contents by vomiting.
The gastric contents, in whatever degree of dilution or concentration
they may have been ingested, when ejected are of porridge-thick
consistency, and often but slightly digested. Such
conditions may succeed a severe alcoholic bout, be caused by
irritant substances taken in by the mouth or arise from fermentative
processes in the stomach contents themselves. Should
the irritating material succeed in passing from the stomach into
the bowel, similar physical signs are present; but as the quickest
path offered for the expulsion of the offending substances from
the body is downwards, peristalsis is increased, the flow of fluid
from the intestinal glands is larger in bulk, though of less potency
as regards its normal actions, than in health, and diarrhoea, with
removal of the irritant, follows. As a general rule, the more
marked the involvement of the large bowel, the severer and more
fluid is the resultant diarrhoea. Inflammation of the stomach
may be due to mechanical injury, thermal or chemical irritants
or invasion by micro-organisms. Also all the symptoms of
gastric catarrh may be brought on by any acute emotion. The
commonest mechanical injury is that due to an excess of food,
especially when following on a fast; poisons act as irritants, and
also the weevils of cheese and the larvae of insects.</p>

<p>Inflammatory affections of the caecum and its attached
appendix vermiformis are very common, and give rise to several
special symptoms and signs. Acute inflammatory appendicitis
appears to be increasing in frequency, and is associated by many
with the modern deterioration in the teeth. Constipation
certainly predisposes to it, and it appears to be more prevalent
among medical men, commercial travellers, or any engaged in
arduous callings, subjected to irregular meals, fatigue and
exposure. A foreign body is the exciting cause in many cases,
though less commonly so than was formerly imagined. The
inflammation in the appendix varies in intensity from a very
slight catarrhal or simple form to an ulcerative variety, and much
more rarely to the acute fulminating appendicitis in which
necrosis of the appendix with abscess formation occurs. It is
always accompanied by more or less peritonitis, which is protective
in nature, shutting in the inflammatory process. Very
similar symptomatically is the condition termed perityphlitis,
doubtless in former days frequently due to the appendix, an acute
or chronic inflammation of the walls of the caecum often leading
to abscess formation outside the gut, with or without direct
communication with the canal. The colon is subject to three
main forms of inflammation. In simple <i>colitis</i> the mucous
membrane of the colon is intensely injected, bright red in colour,
and secreting a thick mucus, but there is no accompanying
ulceration. It is often found in association with some constitutional
disease, as Bright&rsquo;s disease, and also with cancer of the
bowel. But when it has no association with other trouble it is
probably bacterial in origin, the <i>Bacillus enteritidis spirogenes</i>
having been isolated in many cases. The motions always contain
large quantities of mucus and more or less blood. A second very
severe form of inflammation of the colon is known as &ldquo;membranous
colitis,&rdquo; and this may be either dyspeptic, or secondary to
other diseases. In this trouble membranes are passed <i>per anum</i>,
accompanied by a pain so intense as often to cause fainting. In
severe cases complete tubular casts of the intestine have been
found. Often the motions contain very little faecal matter, but
consist only of membranes, mucus and a little blood. A third
form is that known as &ldquo;ulcerative colitis.&rdquo; Any part of the large
intestine may be affected, and the ulceration shows no special
distribution. In severe cases the muscular coat is exposed, and
perforation may ensue. The number of ulcers varies from a few
to many dozen, and in size from a pea to a five-shilling piece.
Like all chronic intestinal ulcers they show a tendency to become
transverse.</p>

<p>Chronic catarrhal affections of the stomach are very common,
and often follow upon repeated acute attacks. In them the
connective tissue increases at the expense of the glandular
elements; the mucous membrane becomes thickened and less
active in function. Should the muscular coat be involved, the
elasticity and contractility of the organ suffer; peristaltic movement
is weakened; expulsion of the contents through the pylorus
hindered; and, aggravated by these effects, the condition
becomes worse, atonic dyspepsia in its most pronounced form
results, with or without dilatation. Chronic vascular congestion
may occasion in process of time similar signs and symptoms.</p>

<p>Duodenal catarrh is constantly associated with jaundice, indeed
is most probably the commonest cause of catarrhal jaundice; often
it is accompanied by catarrh of the common bile-duct. Chronic
inflammation of the small intestine gives rise to less prominent
symptoms than in the stomach. It generally arises from more than
one cause; or rather secondary causes rapidly become as important
as the primary in its incidence. Chronic congestion and prolonged
irritation lead to deficient secretion and sluggish peristalsis;
these effects encourage intestinal putrefaction and auto-intoxication;
and these latter, in turn, increase the local unrest.</p>

<p>The intestinal mucous membrane, the peritoneum and the
mesenteric glands are the chief sites of tubercular infection in
the digestive organs. Rarely met with in the gullet and
stomach, and comparatively seldom in the mouth and
<span class="sidenote">Infective lesions.</span>
lips, tubercular inflammation of the small intestine
and peritoneum is common. Tubercular enteritis is a frequent
accompaniment of phthisis, but may occur apart from tubercle
of other organs. Children are especially subject to the primary
form. Tubercular peritonitis often is present also. The inflammatory
process readily tends towards ulcer formation, with
haemorrhage and sometimes perforation. If in the large bowel,
the symptoms are usually less acute than those characterizing
tubercular inflammation of the small intestine. The appendix
has been found to be the seat of tubercular processes; in the
rectum they form the general cause of the fistulae and abscesses so
commonly met with here. Tubercular peritonitis may be primary
or secondary, acute or chronic; occasionally very acute cases are
seen running a rapid course; the majority are chronic in type.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>265</span>
The tubercles spread over the surface of the serous membrane,
and if small and not very numerous may give rise in chronic
cases to few symptoms; if larger, and especially when they
involve and obstruct the lymph- and blood-vessels, ascites follows.
It is hardly possible that tubercular invasion of the mesenteric
glands can ever occur unaccompanied by peritoneal infection;
but when the infection of the glands constitutes the most prominent
sign, the term <i>tabes mesenterica</i> is sometimes employed.
Here the glands, enlarged, form a doughy mass in the abdomen,
leading to marked protrusion of the abdominal walls, with
wasting elsewhere and diarrhoea.</p>

<p>The liver is seldom attacked by tubercle, unless in cases of
general miliary tuberculosis. Now and then it contains large
caseous tubercular masses in its substance.</p>

<p>An important fact with regard to the tubercular processes in
the digestive organs lies in the ready response to treatment shown
by many cases of peritoneal or mesenteric invasion, particularly
in the young.</p>

<p>The later sequelae of syphilis display a predilection for the
rectum and the liver, usually leading to the development of a
stricture in the former, to a diffuse hepatitis or the formation
of gummata in the second. In inherited syphilis the temporary
teeth usually appear early, are discoloured and soon crumble
away. The permanent teeth may be sound and healthy, but are
often&mdash;especially the upper incisors&mdash;notched and stunted, when
they are known as &ldquo;Hutchinson&rsquo;s teeth.&rdquo; As the result both of
syphilis and of tubercle, the tissues of the liver and bowel may
present a peculiar alteration; they become amyloid, or lardaceous,
a condition in which they appear &ldquo;waxy,&rdquo; are coloured
dark mahogany brown with dilute iodine solutions, and show
degenerative changes in the connective tissue.</p>

<p>The <i>Bacillus typhosus</i> discovered by Eberth is the causal agent
of typhoid fever, and has its chief seat of activity in the small
intestine, more especially in the lower half of the ileum. Attacking
the lymphoid follicles in the mucous membrane, it causes first
inflammatory enlargement, then necrosis and ulceration. The
adjacent portions of the mucous membrane show acute catarrhal
changes. Diarrhoea, of a special &ldquo;pea-soup&rdquo; type, may or may
not be present; while haemorrhage from the bowel, if ulcers have
formed, is common. As the ulcers frequently extend down to the
peritoneal coat of the bowel, perforation of this membrane and
extravasation into the peritoneal cavity is easily induced by
irritants introduced into or elaborated in the bowel, acting
physically or by the excitation of hyper-peristalsis.</p>

<p>True Asiatic cholera is due to the comma-bacillus or spirillum
of cholera, which is found in the rice-water evacuations, in the
contents of the intestine after death, and in the mucous membrane
of the intestine just beneath the epithelium. It has not been
found in the blood. It produces an intense irritation of the bowel,
seldom of the stomach, without giving rise locally to any marked
physical change; it causes violent diarrhoea and copious discharges
of &ldquo;rice-water&rdquo; stools, consisting largely of serum
swarming with the organism.</p>

<p>Dysentery gives rise to an inflammation of the large intestine
and sometimes of the lower part of the ileum, resulting in extensive
ulceration and accompanied by faecal discharges of mucus,
muco-pus or blood. In some forms a protozoan, the <i>Amoeba
dysenteriae</i>, is found in the stools&mdash;this is the amoebic dysentery;
in other cases a bacillus, <i>Bacillus dysenteriae</i>, is found&mdash;the
bacillary dysentery.</p>

<p>Acute parotitis, or mumps, is an infectious disease of the parotid
glands, chiefly interesting because of the association between it
and the testes in males, inflammation of these glands occasionally
following or replacing the affection of the parotids. The causal
agent is probably organismal, but has as yet escaped detection.</p>

<p>The relative frequency with which malignant growths occur in
the different organs of the digestive system may be gathered from
the tabular analysis, on p. 266, of 1768 cases recorded in
the books of the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary as having
<span class="sidenote">New growths.</span>
been treated in the medical and surgical wards between
the years 1892 and 1899 inclusive. Of these, 1263, or 71.44%,
were males; 505, or 28.56%, females. (See Table I. p. 266.)</p>

<p>If the figures there given be classified upon broader lines, the
results are as given in Table II. p. 266, and speak for themselves.</p>

<p>The digestive organs are peculiarly subject to malignant
disease, a result of the incessant changes from passive to active
conditions, and vice versa, called for by repeated introduction
of food; while the comparative frequency with which different
parts are attacked depends, in part, upon the degree of irritation
or changes of function imposed upon them. Scirrhous, encephaloid
and colloid forms of carcinoma occur. In the stomach
and oesophagus the scirrhous form is most common, the soft
encephaloid form coming next. The most common situation for
cancerous growth in the stomach is the pyloric region. Walsh out
of 1300 cases found 60.8% near the pylorus, 11.4% over the
lesser curvature, and 4.7% more or less over the whole organ.
The small intestine is rarely attacked by cancer; the large
intestine frequently. The rectum, sigmoid flexure, caecum and
colon are affected, and in this order, the cylindrical-celled form
being the most common. Carcinoma of the peritoneum is
generally colloid in character, and is often secondary to growths in
other organs. Cancer of the liver follows cancer of the stomach
and rectum in frequency of occurrence, and is relatively more
common in females than males. Secondary invasion of the liver
is a frequent sequel to gastric cancer. The pancreas occasionally
is the seat of cancerous growth.</p>

<p>Sarcomata are not so often met with in the digestive organs.
When present, they generally involve the peritoneum or the
mesenteric glands. The liver is sometimes attacked, the stomach
rarely.</p>

<p>Benign tumours are not of common occurrence in the digestive
organs. Simple growths of the salivary glands, cysts of the
pancreas and polypoid tumours of the rectum are the most
frequent.</p>

<p>The intestinal canal is the habitat of the majority of animal
parasites found in man. Frequently their presence leads to no
morbid symptoms, local or general; nor are the symptoms, when
they do arise, always characteristic of the presence of
<span class="sidenote">Animal parasites.</span>
parasites alone.  Discovery of their bodies, or of their
eggs, in the stools is in most instances the only satisfactory
proof of their presence. The parasites found in the bowel
belong principally to two natural groups, Protozoa and Metazoa.
The great class of the Protozoa furnish amoebae, members of
Sporozoa and Infusoria. The amoebae are almost invariably
found in the large intestine; one species, indeed, is termed <i>Amoeba
coli</i>. The frequently observed relation between attacks of
dysentery and the presence of amoebae in the stools has led to the
proposition that an <i>Amoeba dysenterica</i> exists, causing the disease&mdash;a
theory supported by the detection of amoebae in the contents
of dysenteric abscesses of the liver. No symptoms of injury to
health appear to accompany the presence of Sporozoa in the
bowel, while the species of Infusoria found in it, the <i>Cercomonas</i>,
and <i>Trichomonas intestinalis</i>, and the <i>Balantidium coli</i>, may or
may not be guilty of prolonging conditions within the bowel
as have previously set up diarrhoea.</p>

<p>The Metazoa supply examples of intestinal parasites from the
classes Annuloida and Nematoidea. To the former class belong
the various tapeworms found in the small intestine of man.
They, like other intestinal parasites, are destitute of any power
of active digestion, simply absorbing the nutritious proceeds of
the digestive processes of their hosts. Nematode worms infest
both the small and large intestine; <i>Ascaris lumbricoides</i>, the
common round worm, and the male <i>Oxyuris vermicularis</i> are
found in the small bowel, the adult female <i>Oxyuris vermicularis</i>
and the <i>Tricocephalus dispar</i> in the large.</p>

<p>The eggs of the <i>Trichina spiralis</i>, when introduced with the
food, develop in the bowel into larval forms which invade the
tissues of the body, to find in the muscles congenial spots wherein
to reach maturity. Similarly, the eggs of the Echinococcus
are hatched in the bowel, and the embryos proceed to take
up their abode in the tissues of the body, developing into cysts
capable of growth into mature worms after their ingestion by
dogs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>266</span></p>

<p>Numbers of bacterial forms habitually infest the alimentary
canal. Many of them are non-pathogenic; some develop pathogenic
characters only under provocation or when a
suitable environment induces them to act in such a
<span class="sidenote">Vegetable parasites.</span>
manner; others may form the <i>materies morbi</i> of special
lesions, or be casual visitors capable of originating disease if
opportunity occurs. Apart from those organisms associated with
acute infective diseases, disturbances of function and physical
lesions may be the result of abnormal bacterial activity in the
canal; and these disturbances may be both local and general.
Many of the bacteria commonly present produce putrefactive
changes in the contents of the tract by their metabolic processes.
They render the medium they grow in alkaline, produce different
gases and elaborate more or less virulent toxins. Other species
set up an acid fermentation, seldom accompanied by gas or toxin
formation. The products of either class are inimical to the free
growth of members of the other. The species which produce acids
are more resistant to the action of acids. Thus, when the contents
of the stomach possess a normal or excessive proportion of free
hydrochloric acid, a much larger number of putrefactive and
pathogenic organisms in the food are destroyed or inhibited than
of the bacteria of acid fermentation. Diminished gastric acidity
allows of the entry of a greater number of putrefactive (and
pathogenic) types, with, as a consequence, increased facilities
for their growth and activity, and the appearance of intestinal
derangements.</p>

<p>In a healthy new-born infant the mouth is free from micro-organisms,
and very few are found in a breast-fed baby, but
<i>Bacillus lactis</i> may be found where the child is bottle fed.
If there is trouble with the first dentition and food is allowed
to collect, staphylococci, streptococci, pneumococci and colon
bacilli may be present. Even in healthy babies <i>Oidium albicans</i>
may be present, and in older children the pseudo-diphtheria
bacillus. From carious teeth may be isolated streptothrix,
leptothrix, spirilla and fusiform bacilli. Under conditions of
health these micro-organisms live in the mouth as saprophytes,
and show no virulence when cultivated
and injected into animals.
The two common pyogenetic organisms,
<i>Staphylococcus albus</i> and
<i>brevis</i>, show no virulence. Also
the pneumococcus, though often
present, must be raised in virulence
before it can produce untoward
results. The foulness of the mouth
is supposed to be due to the colon
bacillus and its allies, but those
obtained from the mouth are innocuous.
Also to enable the <i>Oidium
albicans</i> to attack the mucous membrane
there must be some slight
inflammation or injury. The micro-organisms
found in the stomach
gain access to that organ in the
food or by regurgitation from the
small intestine. Most are relatively
inert, but some have a special fermentative
action on the food (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Nutrition</a></span>). Abelous isolated sixteen
distinct species of organism
from a healthy stomach, including
Sarcinae, <i>B. lactis</i>, <i>pyocyaneus</i>,
<i>subtilis</i>, <i>lactis erythrogenes</i>, <i>amylobacter</i>,
<i>megatherium</i>, and <i>Vibrio
rugula</i>.</p>

<p>Hare-lip, cleft palate, hernia
and imperforate anus are physical
abnormalities which are interesting to the surgeon rather than to
the pathologist. The oesophagus may be the seat of a diverticulum,
or blind pouch, usually situated in its lower half, which in
<span class="sidenote">Physical abnormalities</span>
most instances is probably partly acquired and partly
congenital; a local weakness succumbing to pressure.
Hypertrophy of the muscular coat of the pyloric region
is an infrequent congenital gastric anomaly in infants,
preventing the passage of food into the bowel, and causing death
in a short time. Incomplete closure
of the vitelline duct results in
the presence of a diverticulum&mdash;Meckel&rsquo;s&mdash;generally
connected with
the ileum, mainly important by
reason of the readiness with which
it occasions intestinal obstruction.
Idiopathic congenital dilatation of
the colon has been described.</p>

<p>Traction diverticula of the oesophagus
not uncommonly occur as
sequels to suppurative inflammation
of cervical lymphatic glands.
More frequently dilatation of a section is met with, due as a
rule to the presence of a stricture. The stomach often diverges
from the normal in size, shape and position. Normally capable
in the adult of containing from fifty to sixty ounces, either by
reason of organic disease, or as the result of functional disturbance,
its capacity may vary enormously. The writer has seen
post mortem a stomach which held a gallon (160 ounces), and
again one holding only two ounces. Cancer spread over a large
area and cirrhosis of the stomach wall cause diminution in
capacity; pyloric obstruction, weakness of the muscular coat,
and nervous influences are associated with dilatation. A peculiar
distortion of the shape of the stomach follows cicatrization of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>267</span>
ulcers of greater or lesser curvature; the gastric cavity becomes
&ldquo;hour-glass&rdquo; in shape. In addition, the stomach may be displaced
downwards as a whole, a condition known as gastroptosis:
if the pyloric portion only be displaced, the lesion is termed
pyloroptosis. Ptoses of other abdominal organs are described;
the liver, transverse colon, spleen and kidneys may be involved.
Displacements downwards of the stomach and transverse colon,
along with a movable right kidney and associated with dyspepsia
and neurasthenia, form the malady termed by Glénard enteroptosis.
A general visceroptosis often occurs in those patients
who have some tuberculous lesion of the lungs or elsewhere,
this disease causing a general weakening and subsequent
stretching of all ligaments. Displacements of the abdominal
viscera are almost invariably accompanied by symptoms of
dyspepsia of a neurotic type. The rectum is liable to prolapse,
consequent upon constipation and straining at stool, or following
local injuries of the perineal floor.</p>

<p>Every pathological lesion shown by digestive organs is closely
associated with the state of the nervous system, general or local;
so stoppage of active gastric digestive processes after
profound nervous shock, and occurrence of nervous
<span class="sidenote">Influence of the nervous system.</span>
diarrhoea from the same cause. Gastric dyspepsia
of nervous origin presents most varied and contradictory
symptoms: diminished acidity of the gastric juice,
hyper-acidity, over-production, arrest of secretion, lessened or
increased movements, greater sensitiveness to the presence of
contents, dilatation or spasm. Often the nervous cause can
be traced back farther,&mdash;in females, frequently to the pelvic
organs; in both sexes, to the condition of the blood, the brain or
the bowel. Unhealthy conditions related to evacuation of the
bowel-contents commonly induce reflex nervous manifestations of
abnormal character referred to the stomach and liver. Gastric
disturbances similarly react upon the proper conduct of intestinal
functions.</p>

<p class="center pt2"><i>Local Diseases.</i></p>

<p><i>The Mouth.</i>&mdash;The lining membrane of the cheeks inside the
mouth, of the gums and the under-surface and edges of the
tongue, is often the seat of small irritable ulcers, usually associated
with some digestive derangement. A crop of minute vesicles
known as Koplik&rsquo;s spots over these parts has been lately stated
by Koplik to be an early symptom of measles. Xerostomia, or
dry mouth, is a rare condition, connected with lack of salivary
secretion. Gangrenous stomatitis, cancrum oris, or noma,
occasionally attacks debilitated children, or patients convalescing
from acute fevers, more especially after measles. It commences
in the gums or cheeks, and causes widespread sloughing of the
adjacent soft parts&mdash;it may be of the bones.</p>

<p><i>The Stomach.</i>&mdash;It were futile to attempt to enumerate all the
protean manifestations of disturbance which proceed from a disordered
stomach. The possible permutations and combinations
of the causes of gastric vagaries almost reach infinity. Idiosyncrasy,
past and present gastric education, penury or plethora,
actual digestive power, motility, bodily requirements and conditions,
environment, mental influences, local or adjacent organic
lesions, and, not least, reflex impressions from other organs, all
contribute to the variance.</p>

<p>Ulcer of the stomach, however&mdash;the perforating gastric ulcer&mdash;occupies
a unique position among diseases of this organ.
Gastric ulcers are circumscribed, punched out, rarely larger than
a sixpenny-bit, funnel-shaped, the narrower end towards the
peritoneal coat, and distributed in those regions of the stomach
wall which are most exposed to the action of the gastric contents.
They occur most frequently in females, especially if anaemic, and
are usually accompanied by excess of acid, actual or relative
to the state of the blood, in the stomach contents. Local pain,
dorsal pain, generally to the left of the eighth or ninth dorsal
spinous process, and haematernesis and melaena, are symptomatic
of it. The amount of blood lost varies with the rapidity of
ulcer formation and the size of vessel opened into. Fatal results
arise from ulceration into large blood-vessels, followed by copious
haemorrhage, or by perforation of the ulcer into the peritoneal
cavity. Scars of such ulcers may be found post mortem, although
no symptoms of gastric disease have been exhibited during life;
gastric ulcers, therefore, may be latent.</p>

<p>Irritation of the sensory nerve-endings in the stomach wall
from the presence of an increased proportion of acid, organic or
mineral, in the stomach contents is accountable for the well known
symptom heartburn. Water-brash is a term applied to
eructation of a colourless, almost tasteless fluid, probably saliva,
which has collected in the lower part of the oesophagus from
failure of the cardiac sphincter of the stomach to relax; reversed
oesophageal peristalsis causing regurgitation. A similar reversed
action serves in merycism, or rumination, occasionally found in
man, to raise part of the food, lately ingested, from the stomach to
the mouth. Vomiting also is aided by reversed peristaltic action,
both of the stomach and the oesophagus, with the help of the
diaphragm and the muscles of the anterior abdominal wall.
Emesis may be caused both by local nervous influence, and
through the central nervous mechanism either reflexly or from
the direct action of substances circulating in the blood. Further,
the causal agent acting on the central nervous apparatus may be
organic or functional, as well as medicinal. Vomiting without
any apparent cause suggests nervous lesions, organic or reflex.
The obstinate vomiting of pregnancy is a case in point. Here the
primary cause proceeds reflexly from the pelvis. In females the
pelvic organs are often the true source of emesis. Haematemesis
accompanies gastric ulcer, cancer, chronic congestion with
haemorrhagic erosion, congestion of the liver, or may follow
violent acts of vomiting. In cases of ulcer the blood is usually
bright and in considerable amount; in cancer, darker, like coffee-grounds;
and in cases of erosion, in smaller quantity and of bright
colour. The reaction of the stomach contents, if the cause be
doubtful, yields valuable aid towards a diagnosis. Of increased
acidity in gastric ulcer, normal in hepatic congestion, it is
diminished in cancer; but as the acid present in cancer is largely
lactic, analysis of the gastric contents must often be a <i>sine qua
non</i>, because hyperacidity from lactic may obscure hypoacidity of
hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p>Flatulence usually results from fermentative processes in
the stomach and bowel, as the outcome of bacterial activity. A
different form of flatulence is common in neurotic individuals:
in such the gas evolved consists simply in carbonic acid liberated
from the blood, and its evolution is generally characterized by
rapid development and by lack of all fermentative signs.</p>

<p><i>The Liver.</i>&mdash;The liver is an organ frequently libelled for the
delinquencies of other organs, and regarded as a common source of
ill. In catarrhal jaundice it is in most cases the bowel that is at
fault, the liver acting properly, but unable to get rid of all the bile
produced. The liver suffers, however, from several diseases of its
own. Its fibrous or connective tissue is very apt to increase
at the expense of the cellular elements, destroying their functions.
This cirrhotic process usually follows long-continued irritation,
such as is produced by too much alcohol absorbed from the bowel
habitually, the organ gradually becoming harder in texture and
smaller in bulk. Hypertrophic cirrhosis of the liver is not uncommonly
met with, in which the liver is much increased in size,
the &ldquo;unilobular&rdquo; form, also of alcoholic origin. In still-born
children and in some infants a form of hypertrophic cirrhosis is
occasionally seen, probably of hereditary syphilitic origin. Acute
congestion of the liver forms an important symptom of malarial
fever, and often leads in time to establishment of cirrhotic changes;
here the liver is generally enlarged, but not invariably so, and the
part played by alcohol in its causation has still to be investigated.
Acute yellow atrophy of the liver is a disease <i>sui generis</i>. Of rare
occurrence, possibly of toxic origin, it is marked by jaundice, at
first of usual type, later becoming most intense; by vomiting;
haemorrhages widely distributed; rapid diminution in the size of
the liver; the appearance of leucin and tyrosin in the urine, with
lessened urea; and in two or three days, death. The liver after
death is soft, of a reddish colour dotted with yellow patches, and
weighs only about a third part of the normal&mdash;about 1½ lb in
place of 3¾ lb. A closely analogous affection of the liver, known
as Weil&rsquo;s disease, is of infectious type, and has been noted in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>268</span>
epidemic form. In this the spleen and liver are commonly but
not always swollen, and the liver is often tender on pressure. As
a large proportion of the sufferers from this disease have been
butchers, and the epidemics have occurred in the hot season of
the year, it probably arises from contact with decomposing
animal matter. Hepatic abscess may follow on an attack of
amoebic dysentery, and is produced either by infection through
the portal vein, or by direct infection from the adjacent colon.
In general pyaemia multiple small abscesses may occur in the
liver.</p>

<p><i>The Gall-Bladder.</i>&mdash;The formation of biliary calculi in the gall-bladder
is the chief point of interest here. At least 75% of such
cases occur in women, especially in those who have borne children.
Tight-lacing has been stated to act as an exciting cause, owing to
the consequent retardation of the flow of bile. Gall-stones may
number from one to many thousands. They are largely composed
of cholesterin, combined with small amounts of bile-pigments
and acids, lime and magnesium salts. Their presence
may give rise to no symptoms, or may cause violent biliary colic,
and, if the bile-stream be obstructed, to jaundice. Inflammatory
processes may be initiated in the gall-bladder or the bile-ducts,
catarrhal or suppurative in character.</p>

<p><i>The Pancreas.</i>&mdash;Haemorrhages into the body of the pancreas,
acute and chronic inflammation, calculi, cysts and tumours,
among which cancer is by far the most common, are recognized as
occurring in this organ; the point of greatest interest regarding
them lies in the relations established between pancreatic disease
and diabetes mellitus, affections of the gland frequently being
complicated by, and probably causing, the appearance of sugar in
the urine.</p>

<p><i>The Small Intestine.</i>&mdash;Little remains to be added to the account
of inflammatory lesions in connexion with the small intestine. It
offers but few conditions peculiar to itself, save in typhoid fever,
and the ease with which it contrives to become kinked, or intussuscepted,
producing obstruction, or to take part in hernial
protrusions. The first section, the duodenum, is subject to
development of ulcers very similar to those of the gastric mucous
membrane. For long duodenal ulceration has been regarded as a
complication of extensive burns of the skin, but the relationship
between them has not yet been quite satisfactorily explained.
The condition of colic in the bowel usually arises from overdistension
of some part of the small gut with gas, the frequent
sharp turns of the gut facilitating temporary closure of its lumen
by pressure of the dilated gut near a curve against the part

<p><i>The Large Intestine.</i>&mdash;The colon, especially the ascending
portion, may become immensely dilated, usually after prolonged
constipation and paralysis of the gut; occasionally the condition
is congenital. Straining efforts made in defaecation may often
account for prolapse of the lower end of the rectum through the
anus. Haemorrhage from the bowel is usually a sign of disease
situated in the large intestine: if bright in colour, the source is
probably low down; if dark, from the caecum or from above the
ileo-caecal valve. Blood after a short stay in any section of the
alimentary canal darkens, and eventually becomes almost black
in colour.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIGIT<a name="ar93" id="ar93"></a></span> (Lat. <i>digitus</i>, finger), literally a finger or toe, and so used
to mean, from counting on the fingers, a single numeral, or, from
measuring, a finger&rsquo;s breadth. In astronomy a digit is the twelfth
part of the diameter of the sun or moon; it is used to express the
magnitude of an eclipse.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DIGITALIS.<a name="ar94" id="ar94"></a></span> The leaves of the foxglove (<i>q.v.</i>), gathered from
wild plants when about two-thirds of their flowers are expanded,
deprived usually of the petiole and the thicker part of the midrib,
bitter taste; and to preserve their properties they must be kept
excluded from light in stoppered bottles. They are occasionally
adulterated with the leaves of <i>Inula Conyza</i>, ploughman&rsquo;s
spikenard, which may be distinguished by their greater roughness,
their less divided margins, and their odour when rubbed;
also with the leaves of <i>Symphytum officinale</i>, comfrey, and of
<i>Verbascum Thapsus</i>, great mullein, which unlike those of the
foxglove have woolly upper and under surfaces. The earliest
known descriptions of the foxglove are those given by Leonhard
Fuchs and Tragus about the middle of the 16th century, but its
virtues were doubtless known to herbalists at a much remoter
period. J. Gerarde, in his <i>Herbal</i> (1597), advocates the use of
foxglove for a variety of complaints; and John Parkinson, in the
<i>Theatrum Botanicum</i>, or <i>Theater of Plants</i> (1640), and later W.
Salmon, in <i>The New London Dispensatory</i>, similarly praised the
remedy. Digitalis was first brought prominently under the
notice of the medical profession by Dr W. Withering, who, in his
<i>Account of the Foxglove</i> (1785), gave details of upwards of 200
cases chiefly dropsical, in which it was used.</p>

<p>Digitalis contains four important glucosides, of which three are
cardiac stimulants. The most powerful is <i>digitoxin</i> C<span class="su">34</span>H<span class="su">54</span>O<span class="su">11</span>,
an extremely poisonous and cumulative drug, insoluble in water.
<i>Digitalin</i>, C<span class="su">35</span>H<span class="su">56</span>O<span class="su">14</span>, is crystalline and is also insoluble in water.
<i>Digitalein</i> is amorphous but readily soluble in water. It can
therefore be administered subcutaneously, in doses of about one-hundredth
of a grain. <i>Digitonin</i>, on the other hand, is a cardiac
depressant, and has been found to be identical with saponin,
the chief constituent of senega root. There are numerous preparations,
patent and pharmacopeial, their composition being
extremely varied, so that, unless one has reason to be certain of
any particular preparation, it is almost better to use only the
dried leaves themselves in the form of a powder (dose ½-2 grains).
The pharmacopeial tincture may be given in doses of five to
fifteen minims, and the infusion has the unusually small dose of
two to four drachms&mdash;the dose of other infusions being an ounce
or more. The tincture contains a fair proportion of both digitalin
and digitoxin.</p>

<p>Digitalis leaves have no definite external action. Taken by the
mouth, the drug is apt to cause considerable digestive disturbance,
varying in different cases and sometimes so severe as to cause
serious difficulty. This action is probably due to the digitonin,
which is thus a constituent in every way undesirable. The all-important
property of the drug is its action on the circulation.
Its first action on any of the body-tissues is upon unstriped
muscle, so that the first consequence of its absorption is a contraction
of the arteries and arterioles. No other known drug has
an equally marked action in contracting the arterioles. As the
vaso-motor centre in the medulla oblongata is also stimulated, as
well as the contractions of the heart, there is thus trebly caused a
very great rise in the blood-pressure.</p>

<p>The clinical influence of digitalis upon the heart is very well
defined. After the taking of a moderate dose the pulse is
markedly slowed. This is due to a very definite influence upon
the different portions of the cardiac cycle. The systole is not
altered in length, but the diastole is very much prolonged, and
since this is the period not only of cardiac rest but also of cardiac
&ldquo;feeding&rdquo;&mdash;the coronary vessels being compressed and occluded
during systole&mdash;the result is greatly to benefit the nutrition of the
cardiac muscle. So definite is this that, despite a great increase
in the force of the contractions and despite experimental proof
that the heart does more work in a given time under the influence
of digitalis, the organ subsequently displays all the signs of having
rested, its improved vigour being really due to its obtaining a
larger supply of the nutrient blood. Almost equally striking is
the fact that digitalis causes an irregular pulse to become regular.
Added to the greater force of cardiac contraction is a permanent
tonic contraction of the organ, so that its internal capacity is
reduced. The bearing of this fact on cases of cardiac dilatation
is evident. In larger doses a remarkable sequel to these actions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>269</span>
may be observed. The cardiac contractions become irregular, the
ventricle assumes curious shapes&mdash;&ldquo;hour-glass,&rdquo; &amp;c.&mdash;becomes
very pale and bloodless, and finally the heart stops in a state of
spasm, which shortly afterwards becomes rigor-mortis. Before
this final change the heart may be started again by the application
of a soluble potassium salt, or by raising the fluid pressure
within it. Clinically it is to be observed that the drug is cumulative,
being very slowly excreted, and that after it has been taken
for some time the pulse may become irregular, the blood-pressure
low, and the cardiac pulsations rapid and feeble. These
symptoms with more or less gastro-intestinal irritation and
decrease in the quantity of urine passed indicate digitalis poisoning.
The initial action of digitalis is a stimulation of the cardiac
terminals of the vagus nerves, so that the heart&rsquo;s action is slowed.
Thereafter follows the most important effect of the drug, which is
a direct stimulation of the cardiac muscle. This can be proved to
occur in a heart so embryonic that no nerves can be recognized in
it, and in portions of cardiac muscle that contain neither nervecells
nor nerve-fibres.</p>

<p>The action of this drug on the kidney is of importance only
second to its action on the circulation. In small or moderate
doses it is a powerful diuretic. Though Heidenhain asserts that
rise in the renal blood-pressure has not a diuretic action per se,
it seems probable that this influence of the drug is due to a rise
in the general blood-pressure associated with a relatively dilated
condition of the renal vessels. In large doses, on the other hand,
the renal vessels also are constricted and the amount of urine falls.
It is probable that digitalis increases the amount of water rather
than that of the urinary solids. In large doses the action of
digitalis on the circulation causes various cerebral symptoms,
such as seeing all objects blue, and various other disturbances of
the special senses. There appears also to be a specific action of
lowering the reflex excitability of the spinal cord.</p>

<p>Digitalis is used in therapeutics exclusively for its action on the
circulation. In prescribing this drug it must be remembered that
fully three days elapse before it gets into the system, and thus it
must always be combined with other remedies to tide the patient
over this period. It must never be prescribed in large doses to
begin with, as some patients are quite unable to take it, intractable
vomiting being caused. The three days that must pass before
any clinical effect is obtained renders it useless in an emergency.
A certain consequence of its use is to cause or increase cardiac
hypertrophy&mdash;a condition which has its own dangers and
ultimately disastrous consequences, and must never be provoked
beyond the positive needs of the case. But digitalis is indicated
whenever the heart shows itself unequal to the work it has to
perform. This formula includes the vast majority of cardiac
cases. The drug is contra-indicated in all cases where the heart is
already beating too slowly; in aortic incompetence&mdash;where the
prolongation of diastole increases the amount of the blood that
regurgitates through the incompetent valve; in chronic Bright&rsquo;s
disease and in fatty degeneration of the heart&mdash;since nothing can
cause fat to become contractile.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIGNE,<a name="ar95" id="ar95"></a></span> the chief town of the department of the Basses Alpes,
in S.E. France, 14 m. by a branch line from the main railway
line between Grenoble and Avignon. Pop. (1906), town, 4628;
commune, 7456. The Ville Haute is built on a mountain spur
running down to the left bank of the Bléone river, and is composed
of a labyrinth of narrow winding streets, above which towers the
present cathedral church, dating from the end of the 15th century,
but largely reconstructed in modern times, and the former
bishop&rsquo;s palace (now the prison). The fine Boulevard Gassendi
separates the Ville Haute from the Ville Basse, which is of modern
date. The old cathedral (Notre Dame du Bourg) is a building of
the 13th century, but is now disused except for funerals: it
stands at the east end of the Ville Basse. The neighbourhood of
Digne is rich in orchards, which have long made the town famous
in France for its preserved fruits and confections. It is the <i>Dinia</i>
of the Romans, and was the capital of the Bodiontii. From the
early 6th century at least it has been an episcopal see, which till
1790 was in the ecclesiastical province of Embrun, but since 1802
in that of Aix en Provence. The history of Digne in the middle
ages is bound up with that of its bishops, under whom it prospered
greatly. But it suffered much during the religious wars of the
16th and 17th centuries, when it was sacked several times. A
little way off, above the right bank of the Bléone, is Champtercier,
the birthplace of the astronomer Gassendi (1592-1655), whose
name has been given to the principal thoroughfare of the little
town.</p>

Saône-et-Loire, on the right bank of the Loire, 55 m. W.N.W.
of Mâcon on the Paris-Lyon railway. Pop. (1906) 5321. It is
situated at the meeting places of the Loire, the Lateral canal of the
Loire and the Canal du Centre, which here crosses the Loire by a
fine aqueduct. The town carries on considerable manufactures of
faience, pottery and porcelain. The port on the Canal du Centre
has considerable traffic in timber, sand, iron, coal and stone.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DIJON,<a name="ar97" id="ar97"></a></span> a town of eastern France, capital of the department of
Côte d&rsquo;Or and formerly capital of the province of Burgundy,
195 m. S.E. of Paris on the Paris-Lyon railway. Pop. (1906)
65,516. It is situated on the western border of the fertile plain of
Burgundy, at the foot of Mont Afrique, the north-eastern summit
of the Côte d&rsquo;Or range, and at the confluence of the Ouche and the
Suzon; it also has a port on the canal of Burgundy. The great
strategic importance of Dijon as a centre of railways and roads,
and its position with reference to an invasion of France from the
Rhine, have led to the creation of a fortress forming part of the
Langres group. There is no <i>enceinte</i>, but on the east side detached
forts, 3 to 4 m. distant from the centre, command all the great
roads, while the hilly ground to the west is protected by Fort
Hauteville to the N.W. and the &ldquo;groups&rdquo; of Motte Giron and
Mont Afrique to the S.W., these latter being very formidable
works. Including a fort near Saussy (about 8 m. to the N.W.)
protecting the water-supply of Dijon, there are eight forts,
besides the groups above mentioned. The fortifications which
partly surrounded the old and central portion of the city have
disappeared to make way for tree-lined boulevards with fine
squares at intervals. The old churches and historic buildings of
Dijon are to be found in the irregular streets of the old town, but
industrial and commercial activity has been transferred to the
new quarters beyond its limits. A fine park more than 80 acres
in extent lies to the south of the city, which is rich in open spaces
and promenades, the latter including the botanical garden and
the Promenade de l&rsquo;Arquebuse, in which there is a black poplar
famous for its size and age.</p>

<p>The cathedral of St Bénigne, originally an abbey church,
was built in the latter half of the 13th century on the site of a
Romanesque basilica, of which the crypt remains. The west
front is flanked by two towers and the crossing is surmounted by
a slender timber spire. The plan consists of three naves, short
transepts and a small choir, without ambulatory, terminating in
three apses. In the interior there is a fine organ and a quantity of
statuary, and the vaults contain the remains of Philip the Bold,
duke of Burgundy, and Anne of Burgundy, daughter of John
the Fearless. The site of the abbey buildings is occupied by
the bishop&rsquo;s palace and an ecclesiastical seminary. The church
of Notre-Dame, typical of the Gothic style of Burgundy, was
erected from 1252 to 1334, and is distinguished for the grace of
its interior and the beauty of the western façade. The portal
consists of three arched openings, above which are two stages of
arcades, open to the light and supported on slender columns.
A row of gargoyles surmounts each storey of the façade, which is
also ornamented by sculptured friezes. A turret to the right of
the portal carries a clock called the Jaquemart, on which the hours
are struck by two figures. The church of St Michel belongs to the
15th century. The west façade, the most remarkable feature of
the church, is, however, of the Renaissance period. The vaulting
of the three portals is of exceptional depth owing to the projection
of the lower storey of the façade. Above this storey rise two
towers of five stages, the fifth stage being formed by an octagonal
cupola. The columns decorating the façade represent all the four
orders. The design of this façade is wrongly attributed to Hugues
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>270</span>
Sambin (fl. c. 1540), a native of Dijon, and pupil of Leonardo da
Vinci, but the sculpture of the portals, including &ldquo;The Last
Judgment&rdquo; on the tympanum of the main portal, is probably
from his hand. St Jean (15th century) and St Étienne (15th,
16th and 17th centuries), now used as the exchange, are the other
chief churches. Of the ancient palace of the dukes of Burgundy
there remain two towers, the Tour de la Terrasse and the Tour
de Bar, the guard-room and the kitchens; these now form part
of the hôtel de ville, the rest of which belongs to the 17th and
18th centuries. This building contains an archaeological museum
with a collection of Roman stone monuments; the archives of
the town; and the principal museum, which, besides valuable
paintings and other works of art, contains the magnificent tombs
of Philip the Bold and John the Fearless, dukes of Burgundy.
These were transferred from the Chartreuse of Dijon (or of
Champmol), built by Philip the Bold as a mausoleum, now replaced
by a lunatic asylum. Relics of it survive in the old Gothic
entrance, the portal of the church, a tower and the well of Moses,
which is adorned with statues of Moses and the prophets by
Claux Sluter (fl. end of 14th century), the Dutch sculptor, who
also designed the tomb of Philip the Bold. The Palais de
Justice, which belongs to the reign of Louis XII., is of interest as
the former seat of the <i>parlement</i> of Burgundy. Dijon possesses
several houses of the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries, notably the
Maison Richard in the Gothic, and the Hôtel Vogüé in the
Renaissance style. St Bernard, the composer J. P. Rameau and
the sculptor François Rude have statues in the town, of which
they were natives. There are also monuments to those inhabitants
of Dijon who fell in the engagement before the town
in 1870, and to President Carnot and Garibaldi.</p>

<p>The town is important as the seat of a prefecture, a bishopric, a
court of appeal and a court of assizes, and as centre of an académie
(educational district). There are tribunals of first instance and of
commerce, a board of trade-arbitrators, a chamber of commerce,
an exchange (occupying the former cathedral of St Étienne), and
an important branch of the Bank of France. Its educational
establishments include faculties of law, of science and of letters, a
preparatory school of medicine and pharmacy, a higher school of
commerce, a school of fine art, a conservatoire of music, <i>lycées</i> and
training colleges, and there is a public library with about 100,000
volumes.</p>

<p>Dijon is well known for its mustard, and for the black currant
liqueur called <i>cassis de Dijon</i>; its industries include the manufacture
of machinery, automobiles, bicycles, soap, biscuits,
brandy, leather, boots and shoes, candles and hosiery. There
are also flour mills, breweries, important printing works, vinegar
works and, in the vicinity, nursery gardens. The state has a
large tobacco manufactory in the town. Dijon has considerable
trade in cereals and wool, and is the second market for the wines
of Burgundy.</p>

<p>Under the Romans Dijon (<i>Divonense castrum</i>) was a <i>vicus</i> in
the <i>civitas</i> of Langres. In the 2nd century it was the scene of
the martyrdom of St Benignus (Bénigne, vulg. Berin, Berain),
the apostle of Burgundy. About 274 the emperor Aurelian
surrounded it with ramparts. Gregory of Tours, in the 6th
century, comments on the strength and pleasant situation
of the place, expressing surprise that it does not rank as
a <i>civitas</i>. During the middle ages the fortunes of Dijon
followed those of Burgundy, the dukes of which acquired it
early in the 11th century. The communal privileges, conferred
on the town in 1182 by Hugh III., duke of Burgundy, were
confirmed by Philip Augustus in 1183, and in the 13th century
the dukes took up their residence there. For the decoration of the
palace and other monuments built by them, eminent artists were
gathered from northern France and Flanders, and during this
period the town became one of the great intellectual centres of
France. The union of the duchy with the crown in 1477 deprived
Dijon of the splendour of the ducal court; but to counterbalance
this loss it was made the capital of the province and seat of a
<i>parlement</i>. Its fidelity to the monarchy was tested in 1513,
when the citizens were besieged by 50,000 Swiss and Germans,
and forced to agree to a treaty so disadvantageous that Louis XII.
refused to ratify it. In the wars of religion Dijon sided with the
League, and only opened its gates to Henry IV. in 1595. The
18th century was a brilliant period for the city; it became the
seat of a bishopric, its streets were improved, its commerce
developed, and an academy of science and letters founded;
while its literary salons were hardly less celebrated than those of
Paris. The neighbourhood was the scene of considerable fighting
during the Franco-German War, which was, however, indirectly
of some advantage to the city owing to the impetus given to its
industries by the immigrants from Alsace.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DIKE,<a name="ar98" id="ar98"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Dyke</span> (Old Eng. <i>dic</i>, a word which appears in various
forms in many Teutonic languages, cf. Dutch <i>dijk</i>, German <i>Teich</i>,
Danish <i>dige</i>, and in French, derived from Teutonic, <i>digue</i>; it is
the same word as &ldquo;ditch&rdquo; and is ultimately connected with the
root of &ldquo;dig&rdquo;), properly a trench dug out of the earth for defensive
and other purposes. Water naturally collects in such
trenches, and hence the word is applied to natural and artificial
channels filled with water, as appears in the proverbial expression
&ldquo;February fill-dyke,&rdquo; and in the names of many narrow waterways
in East Anglia. &ldquo;Dike&rdquo; also is naturally used of the bank
of earth thrown up out of the ditch, and so of any embankment,
dam or causeway, particularly the defensive works in Holland,
the Fen district of England, and other low-lying districts which
are liable to flooding by the sea or rivers (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Holland</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Fens</a></span>).
In Scotland any wall, fence or even hedge, used as a boundary is
called a dyke. In geology the term is applied to wall-like masses
of rock (sometimes projecting beyond the surrounding surface)
which fill up vertical or highly inclined fissures in the strata.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DILAPIDATION<a name="ar100" id="ar100"></a></span> (Lat. for &ldquo;scattering the stones,&rdquo; <i>lapides</i>, of a
building), a term meaning in general a falling into decay, but more
particularly used in the plural in English law for (1) the waste
committed by the incumbent of an ecclesiastical living; (2) the
disrepair for which a tenant is usually liable when he has agreed
to give up his premises in good repair (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Easement</a></span>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Flat</a></span>;
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Landlord and Tenant</a></span>). By the general law a tenant for
life has no power to cut down timber, destroy buildings, &amp;c.,
(voluntary waste), or to let buildings fall into disrepair (permissive
waste). In the eye of the law an incumbent of a living is
a tenant for life of his benefice, and any waste, voluntary or permissive,
on his part must be made good by his administrators to
his successor in office. The principles on which such dilapidations
are to be ascertained, and the application of the money payable in
respect thereof, depend partly on old ecclesiastical law and partly
on acts of parliament. Questions as to ecclesiastical dilapidations
usually arise in respect of the residence house and other buildings
belonging to the living. Inclosures, hedges, ditches and the like
are included in things &ldquo;of which the beneficed person hath the
burden and charge of reparation.&rdquo; In a leading case (<i>Ross</i> v.
<i>Adcock</i>, 1868, L.R. 3 C.P. 657) it was said that the court was
acquainted with no precedent or decision extending the liability
of the executors of a deceased incumbent to any species of waste
beyond dilapidation of the house, chancel or other buildings or
fences of the benefice. And it has been held that the mere mismanagement
or miscultivation of the ecclesiastical lands will not
give rise to an action for dilapidations. To place the law relating
to dilapidations on a more satisfactory footing, the Ecclesiastical
Dilapidations Act 1871 was passed. The buildings to which the
act applies are defined to be such houses of residence, chancels,
walls, fences and other buildings and things as the incumbent of
the benefice is by law and custom bound to maintain in repair.
In each diocese a surveyor is appointed by the archdeacons and
rural deans subject to the approval of the bishop; and such
surveyor shall by the direction of the bishop examine the buildings
on the following occasions&mdash;viz. (1) when the benefice is
sequestrated; (2) when it is vacant; (3) at the request of the
incumbent or on complaint by the archdeacon, rural dean or
patron. The surveyor specifies the works required, and gives an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>271</span>
estimate of their probable cost. In the case of a vacant benefice,
the new incumbent and the old incumbent or his representatives
may lodge objections to the surveyor&rsquo;s report on any grounds of
fact or law, and the bishop, after consideration, may make an
order for the repairs and their cost, for which the late incumbent
or his representatives are liable. The sum so stated becomes a
debt due from the late incumbent or his representatives to the
new incumbent, who shall pay over the money when recovered
to the governors of Queen Anne&rsquo;s Bounty. The governors pay
for the works on execution on receipt of a certificate from the
surveyor; and the surveyor, when the works have been completed
to his satisfaction, gives a certificate to that effect, the effect of
which, so far as regards the incumbent, is to protect him from
liability for dilapidations for the next five years. Unnecessary
buildings belonging to a residence house may, by the authority
of the bishop and with the consent of the patron, be removed.
An amending statute of 1872 (Ecclesiastical Dilapidations Act
(1871) Amendment) relates chiefly to advances by the governors
of Queen Anne&rsquo;s Bounty for the purposes of the act.</p>

in common parlance and rhetoric. (1) The latter use has no
exact definition, but in general it describes a situation wherein
from either of two (or more) possible alternatives an unsatisfactory
conclusion results. The alternatives are called the
&ldquo;horns&rdquo; of the dilemma. Thus a nation which has to choose
between bankruptcy and the repudiation of its debts is on the
horns of a dilemma. (2) In logic there is considerable divergence
of opinion as to the best definition. Whately defined it as &ldquo;a
conditional syllogism with two or more antecedents in the major
and a disjunctive minor.&rdquo; Aulus Gellius gives an example as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Women are either fair or ugly; if you marry a fair
woman, she will attract other men; if an ugly woman she will
not please you; therefore marriage is absurd.&rdquo; From either
alternative, an unpleasant result follows. Four kinds of dilemma
are admitted:&mdash;(a) <i>Simple Constructive</i>: If A, then C; if B,
then C, but either B or A; therefore C. (b) <i>Simple Destructive</i>:
If A is true, B is true; if A is true, C is true; B and C are not both
true; therefore A is not true. (c) <i>Complex Constructive</i>: If A,
then B; if C, then D; but either A or C; therefore either B or D.
(d) <i>Complex Destructive</i>: If A is true, B is true; if C is true, D is
true; but B and D are not both true; hence A and C are not
both true. The soundness of the dilemmatic argument in general
depends on the alternative possibilities. Unless the alternatives
produced exhaust the possibilities of the case, the conclusion is
invalid. The logical form of the argument makes it especially
valuable in public speaking, before uncritical audiences. It is, in
fact, important rather as a rhetorical subtlety than as a serious
argument.</p>

arts, especially in music and painting, so a lover of the fine arts
in general. The Ital. <i>dilettare</i> is from Lat. <i>delectare</i>, to delight.
Properly the word refers to an &ldquo;amateur&rdquo; as opposed to a
&ldquo;professional&rdquo; cultivation of the arts, but like &ldquo;amateur&rdquo; it is
often used in a depreciatory sense for one who is only a dabbler,
or who only has a superficial knowledge or interest in art. The
Dilettanti Society founded in 1733-1734 still exists in England.
A history of the society, by Lionel Cust, was published in 1898.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DILIGENCE,<a name="ar105" id="ar105"></a></span> in law, the care which a person is bound to
exercise in his relations with others. The possible degrees of
diligence are of course numerous, and the same degree is not
required in all cases. Thus a mere depositary would not be held
bound to the same degree of diligence as a person borrowing an
article for his own use and benefit. Jurists, following the divisions
of the civil law, have concurred in fixing three approximate
standards of diligence&mdash;viz. ordinary (<i>diligentia</i>), less than
ordinary (<i>levissima diligentia</i>) and more than ordinary
(<i>exactissima diligentia</i>). Ordinary or common diligence is defined
by Story (<i>On Bailments</i>) as &ldquo;that degree of diligence which men
in general exert in respect of their own concerns.&rdquo; So Sir William
Jones:&mdash;&ldquo;This care, which every person of common prudence
and capable of governing a family takes of his own concerns, is
a proper measure of that which would uniformly be required in
performing every contract, if there were not strong reasons for
exacting in some of them a greater and permitting in others a less
degree of attention&rdquo; (<i>Essay on Bailments</i>). The highest degree of
diligence would be that which only very prudent persons bestow
on their own concerns; the lowest, that which even careless
persons bestow on their own concerns. The want of these various
degrees of diligence is negligence in corresponding degrees. These
approximations indicate roughly the greater or less severity with
which the law will judge the performance of different classes of
contracts; but English judges have been inclined to repudiate
the distinction as a useless refinement of the jurists. Thus Baron
Rolfe could see no difference between negligence and gross
negligence; it was the same thing with the addition of a vituperative
epithet. See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Negligence</a></span>.</p>

<p><i>Diligence</i>, in Scots law, is a general term for the process by
which persons, lands or effects are attached on execution, or in
security for debt.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DILKE, SIR CHARLES WENTWORTH,<a name="ar106" id="ar106"></a></span> Bart. (1810-1869),
English politician, son of Charles Wentworth Dilke, proprietor
and editor of <i>The Athenaeum</i>, was born in London on the 18th
of February 1810, and was educated at Westminster school and
Trinity Hall, Cambridge. He studied law, and in 1834 took his
degree of LL.B., but did not practise. He assisted his father in
his literary work, and was for some years chairman of the council
of the Society of Arts, besides taking a prominent part in the
affairs of the Royal Horticultural Society and other bodies. He
was one of the most zealous promoters of the Great Exhibition
(1851), and a member of the executive committee. At the close
of the exhibition he was honoured by foreign sovereigns, and the
queen offered him knighthood, which, however, he did not accept;
he also declined a large remuneration offered by the royal commission.
In 1853 Dilke was one of the English commissioners at
the New York Industrial Exhibition, and prepared a report on it.
He again declined to receive any money reward for his services.
He was appointed one of the five royal commissioners for the
Great Exhibition of 1862; and soon after the death of the prince
consort he was created a baronet. In 1865 he entered parliament
as member for Wallingford. In 1869 he was sent to Russia as
representative of England at the horticultural exhibition held
at St Petersburg. His health, however, had been for some time
failing, and he died suddenly in that city, on the 10th of May 1869.
A selection from his writings, <i>Papers of a Critic</i> (2 vols., 1875),
contains a biographical sketch by his son.</p>

<p>His son, <span class="sc">Sir Charles Wentworth Dilke, Bart.</span> (1843-&emsp;&emsp;),
became a prominent Liberal politician, as M.P. for Chelsea
(1868-1886), under-secretary for foreign affairs (1880-1882), and
president of the local government board (1882-1885); and he
was then marked out as one of the best-informed and ablest of the
advanced Radicals. He was chairman of the royal commission
on the housing of the working classes in 1884-1885. But his
sensational appearance as co-respondent in a divorce case of a
peculiarly unpleasant character in 1885 cast a cloud over his
career. He was defeated in Chelsea in 1886, and did not return
to parliament till 1892, when he was elected for the Forest of
Dean; and though his knowledge of foreign affairs and his
powers as a critic and writer on military and naval questions were
admittedly of the highest order, his official position in public life
could not again be recovered. His military writings are <i>The
British Army</i> (1888); <i>Army Reform</i> (1898) and, with Mr Spenser
Wilkinson, <i>Imperial Defence</i> (1892). On colonial questions he
wrote with equal authority. His <i>Greater Britain</i> (2 vols., 1866-1867)
reached a fourth edition in 1868, and was followed by
<i>Problems of Greater Britain</i> (2 vols., 1890) and <i>The British
Empire</i> (1899). He was twice married, his second wife (née
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>272</span>
Emilia Frances Strong), the widow of Mark Pattison, being
an accomplished art critic and collector. She died in 1904. The
most important of her books were the studies on <i>French Painters
of the Eighteenth Century</i> (1899) and three subsequent volumes on
the architects and sculptors, furniture and decoration, engravers
and draughtsmen of the same period, the last of which appeared
in 1902. A posthumous volume, <i>The Book of the Spiritual Life</i>
(1905), contains a memoir of her by Sir Charles Dilke.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DILL<a name="ar107" id="ar107"></a></span> (<i>Anethum</i> or <i>Peucedanum graveolens</i>), a member of the
natural botanical order Umbelliferae, indigenous to the south of
Europe, Egypt and the Cape of Good Hope. It resembles fennel
in appearance. Its root is long and fusiform; the stem is round,
jointed and about a yard high; the leaves have fragrant leaflets;
and the fruits are brown,
oval and concavo-convex.
The plant flowers
from June till August in
England. The seeds are
sown, preferably as soon
as ripe, either broadcast
or in drills between
6 and 12 in. asunder.
The young plants should
be thinned when 3 or 4
weeks old, so as to be
at distances of about
10 in. A sheltered spot
and dry soil are needed
for the production of the
seed in the climate of England. The leaves of the dill are used in
soups and sauces, and, as well as the umbels, for flavouring
pickles. The seeds are employed for the preparation of dill-water
and oil of dill; they are largely consumed in the manufacture of
gin, and, when ground, are eaten in the East as a condiment.
The British Pharmacopoeia contains the Aqua Anethi or dill-water
(dose 1-2 oz.), and the Oleum Anethi, almost identical in
composition with caraway oil, and given in doses of ½-3 minims.
Dill-water is largely used as a carminative for children, and as a
vehicle for the exhibition of nauseous drugs.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DILLEN<a name="ar108" id="ar108"></a></span> [<span class="sc">Dillenius</span>], <b>JOHANN JAKOB</b> (1684-1747), English
botanist, was born at Darmstadt in 1684, and was educated at the
university of Giessen, where he wrote several botanical papers for
the <i>Ephemerides naturae curiosorum</i>, and printed, in 1719, his
<i>Catalogus plantarum sponte circa Gissam nascentium</i>, illustrated
with figures drawn and engraved by his own hand, and containing
descriptions of many new species. In 1721, at the instance of the
botanist William Sherard (1659-1728), he came to England, and
in 1724 he published a new edition of Ray&rsquo;s <i>Synopsis stirpium
Britannicarum</i>. In 1732 he published <i>Hortus Elthamensis</i>, a
catalogue of the rare plants growing at Eltham, Kent, in the
collection of Sherard&rsquo;s younger brother, James (1666-1738), who,
after making a fortune as an apothecary, devoted himself to
gardening and music. For this work Dillen himself executed 324
plates, and it was described by Linnaeus, who spent a month
with him at Oxford in 1736, and afterwards dedicated his <i>Critica
botanica</i> to him, as &ldquo;opus botanicum quo absolutius mundus non
vidit.&rdquo; In 1734 he was appointed Sherardian professor of botany
at Oxford, in accordance with the will of W. Sherard, who at his
death in 1728 left the university £3000 for the endowment of the
chair, as well as his library and herbarium. Dillen, who was also
the author of an <i>Historia muscorum</i> (1741), died at Oxford, of
apoplexy, on the 2nd of April 1747. His manuscripts, books and
collections of dried plants, with many drawings, were bought by
his successor at Oxford, Dr Humphry Sibthorp (1713-1797), and
ultimately passed into the possession of the university.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DILLINGEN,<a name="ar111" id="ar111"></a></span> a town of Germany, in the kingdom of Bavaria,
on the left bank of the Danube, 25 m. N.E. from Ulm, on the
railway to Ingolstadt. Pop. (1905) 6078. Its principal buildings
are an old palace, formerly the residence of the bishops of
Augsburg and now government offices, a royal gymnasium, a
Latin school with a library of 75,000 volumes, seven churches
(six Roman Catholic), two episcopal seminaries, a Capuchin
monastery, a Franciscan convent and a deaf and dumb asylum.
The university, founded in 1549, was abolished in 1804, being
converted into a lyceum. The inhabitants are engaged in cattle-rearing,
the cultivation of corn, hops and fruit, shipbuilding and
the shipping trade, and the manufacture of cloth, paper and
cutlery. In the vicinity is the Karolinen canal, which cuts off a
bend in the Danube between Lauingen and Dillingen. In 1488
Dillingen became the residence of the bishops of Augsburg; was
taken by the Swedes in 1632 and 1648, by the Austrians in 1702,
and on the 17th of June 1800 by the French. In 1803 it passed

<p><span class="bold">DILLMANN, CHRISTIAN FRIEDRICH AUGUST<a name="ar112" id="ar112"></a></span> (1823-1894),
German orientalist and biblical scholar, the son of a Württemberg
schoolmaster, was born at Illingen on the 25th of April 1823. He
was educated at Tübingen, where he became a pupil and friend of
Heinrich Ewald, and studied under F. C. Baur, though he did not
join the new Tübingen school. For a short time he worked as
pastor at Gersheim, near his native place, but he soon came to
feel that his studies demanded his whole time. He devoted himself
to the study of Ethiopic MSS. in the libraries of Paris, London
and Oxford, and this work caused a revival of Ethiopic study in
the 19th century. In 1847 and 1848 he prepared catalogues of
the Ethiopic MSS. in the British Museum and the Bodleian
library at Oxford. He then set to work upon an edition of the
Ethiopic bible. Returning to Tübingen in 1848, in 1853 he was
appointed professor extraordinarius. Subsequently he became
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>273</span>
professor of philosophy at Kiel (1854), and of theology at Giessen
(1864) and Berlin (1869). He died on the 4th of July 1894.</p>

<p>In 1851 he had published the <i>Book of Enoch</i> in Ethiopian
(German, 1853), and at Kiel he completed the first part of the
Ethiopic bible, <i>Octateuchus Aethiopicus</i> (1853-1855). In 1857
appeared his <i>Grammatik der äthiopischen Sprache</i> (2nd ed. by
C. Bezold, 1899); in 1859 the <i>Book of Jubilees</i>; in 1861 and 1871
another part of the Ethiopic bible, <i>Libri Regum</i>; in 1865 his
great <i>Lexicon linguae aethiopicae</i>; in 1866 his <i>Chrestomathia
aethiopica</i>. Always a theologian at heart, however, he returned
to theology in 1864. His Giessen lectures were published under
the titles, <i>Ursprung der alttestamentlichen Religion</i> (1865) and
<i>Die Propheten des alten Bundes nach ihrer politischen Wirksamkeit</i>
(1868). In 1869 appeared his <i>Commentar zum Hiob</i> (4th ed. 1891)
which stamped him as one of the foremost Old Testament
exegetes. His renown as a theologian, however, was mainly
founded by the series of commentaries, based on those of August
Wilhelm Knobels&rsquo; <i>Genesis</i> (Leipzig, 1875; 6th ed. 1892; Eng.
trans, by W. B. Stevenson, Edinburgh, 1897); <i>Exodus und
Leviticus</i>, 1880, revised edition by V. Ryssel, 1897; <i>Numeri,
Deuteronomium und Josua</i>, with a dissertation on the origin of
the Hexateuch, 1886; <i>Jesaja</i>, 1890 (revised edition by Rudolf
Kittel in 1898). In 1877 he published the <i>Ascension of Isaiah</i>
in Ethiopian and Latin. He was also a contributor to D.
Schenkel&rsquo;s <i>Bibellexikon</i>, Brockhaus&rsquo;s <i>Conversationslexikon</i>, and
Herzog&rsquo;s <i>Realencyklopädie</i>. His lectures on Old Testament
theology, <i>Vorlesungen über Theologie des Allen Testamentes</i>, were
published by Kittel in 1895.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DILLON, ARTHUR RICHARD<a name="ar113" id="ar113"></a></span> (1721-1807), French archbishop,
was the son of Arthur Dillon (1670-1733), an Irish
gentleman who became general in the French service. He was
born at St Germain, entered the priesthood and was successively
curé of Elan near Mezières, vicar-general of Pontoise (1747),
bishop of Evreux (1753) and archbishop of Toulouse (1758),
archbishop of Narbonne in 1763, and in that capacity, president
of the estates of Languedoc. He devoted himself much less to
the spiritual direction of his diocese than to its temporal welfare,
carrying out many works of public utility, bridges, canals, roads,
harbours, &amp;c.; had chairs of chemistry and of physics created at
Montpellier and at Toulouse, and tried to reduce the poverty,
especially in Narbonne. In 1787 and in 1788 he was a member of
the Assembly of Notables called together by Louis XVI., and in
1788 presided over the assembly of the clergy. Having refused
to accept the civil constitution of the clergy, Dillon had to leave
Narbonne in 1790, then to emigrate to Coblenz in 1791. Soon
afterwards he went to London, where he lived until his death in
1807, never accepting the Concordat, which had suppressed his
archiepiscopal see.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DILLON, JOHN<a name="ar114" id="ar114"></a></span> (1851-&emsp;&emsp;), Irish nationalist politician, was
the son of John Blake Dillon (1816-1866), who sat in parliament
for Tipperary, and was one of the leaders of &ldquo;Young Ireland.&rdquo;
John Dillon was educated at the Roman Catholic university of
Dublin, and afterwards studied medicine. He entered parliament
in 1880 as member for Tipperary, and was at first an ardent
supporter of C. S. Parnell. In August he delivered a speech on
the Land League at Kildare which was characterized as &ldquo;wicked
and cowardly&rdquo; by W. E. Forster; he advocated boycotting, and
was arrested in May 1881 under the Coercion Act, and again after
two months of freedom in October. In 1883 he resigned his seat
for reasons of health, but was returned unopposed in 1885 for
East Mayo, which he continued to represent. He was one of the
prime movers in the famous &ldquo;plan of campaign,&rdquo; which provided
that the tenant should pay his rent to the National League instead
of the landlord, and in case of eviction be supported by the general
fund. Mr Dillon was compelled by the court of queen&rsquo;s bench on
the 14th of December 1886 to find securities for good behaviour,
but two days later he was arrested while receiving rents on Lord
Clanricarde&rsquo;s estates. In this instance the jury disagreed, but
in June 1888 under the provisions of the new Criminal Law
Procedure Bill he was condemned to six months&rsquo; imprisonment.
He was, however, released in September, and in the spring of 1889
sailed for Australia and New Zealand, where he collected funds
for the Nationalist party. On his return to Ireland he was again
arrested, but, being allowed bail, sailed to America, and failed to
appear at the trial. He returned to Ireland by way of Boulogne,
where he and Mr W. O&rsquo;Brien held long and indecisive conferences
with Parnell. They surrendered to the police in February, and
on their release from Galway gaol in July declared their opposition
to Parnell. After the expulsion of Mr T. M. Healy and others
from the Irish National Federation, Mr Dillon became the chairman
(February 1896). His early friendship with Mr O&rsquo;Brien
gave place to considerable hostility, but the various sections of
the party were ostensibly reconciled in 1900 under the leadership
of Mr Redmond. In the autumn of 1896 he arranged a convention
of the Irish race, which included 2000 delegates from various
parts of the world. In 1897 Mr Dillon opposed in the House
the Address to Queen Victoria on the occasion of the Diamond
Jubilee, on the ground that her reign had not been a blessing to
Ireland, and he showed the same uncompromising attitude in
1901 when a grant to Lord Roberts was under discussion, accusing
him of &ldquo;systematized inhumanity.&rdquo; He was suspended on the
20th of March for violent language addressed to Mr Chamberlain.
He married in 1895 Elizabeth (d. 1907), daughter of Lord justice
J. C. Mathew.</p>

to a temporal power. In this sense it is obsolete, but is found in
Wycliffe&rsquo;s translation of the Bible&mdash;&ldquo;He gave him dymes of alle

one dimension, a surface has length and breadth, and has two
dimensions, a solid has length, breadth and thickness, and has
three dimensions. This concept is extended to algebra: since
a line, surface and solid are represented by linear, quadratic and
cubic equations, and are of one, two and three dimensions; a
biquadratic equation has its highest terms of four dimensions,
and, in general, an equation in any number of variables which has
the greatest sum of the indices of any term equal to n is said to
have n dimensions. The &ldquo;fourth dimension&rdquo; is a type of non-Euclidean

<p><span class="bold">DINAJPUR,<a name="ar119" id="ar119"></a></span> a town (with a population in 1901 of 13,430) and
district of <span class="correction" title="amended from Britsh">British</span> India, in the Rajshahi division of Eastern
Bengal and Assam. The earthquake of the 12th of June 1897
caused serious damage to most of the public buildings of the town.
There is a railway station and a government high school. The
district comprises an area of 3946 sq. m. It is traversed in every
direction by a network of channels and water courses. Along the
banks of the Kulik river, the undulating ridges and long lines of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>274</span>
mango-trees give the landscape a beauty which is not found elsewhere.
Dinajpur forms part of the rich arable tract lying between
the Ganges and the southern slopes of the Himalayas. Although
essentially a fluvial district, it does not possess any river navigable
throughout the year by boats of 4 tons burden. Rice forms the
staple agricultural product. The climate of the district, although
cooler than that of Calcutta, is very unhealthy, and the people
have a sickly appearance. The worst part of the year is at the
close of the rains in September and October, during which months
few of the natives escape fever. The average maximum temperature
is 92.3° F., and the minimum 74.8°. The average rainfall
is 85.54 in. In 1901 the population was 1,567,080, showing an
increase of 6% in the decade. The district is partly traversed
by the main line of the Eastern Bengal railway and by two branch
lines. Save between 1404 and 1442, when it was the seat of
an independent <i>raj</i>, founded by Raja Ganesh, a Hindu turned
Mussulman, Dinajpur has no separate history. Pillars and
copper-plate inscriptions have yielded numerous records of the
Pal kings who ruled the country from the 9th century onwards,
and the district is famous for many other antiquities, some of
which are connected by legend with an immemorial past (see
<i>Reports, Arch. Survey of India</i>, xv.; <i>Epigraphia Indica</i>, ii.).</p>

arrondissement in the department of Côtes-du-Nord, 37 m. E. of
St Brieuc on the Western railway. Pop. (1906) 8588. Dinan is
situated on a height on the left bank of the Ranee (here canalized),
some 17 m. above its mouth at St Malo, with which it communicates
by means of small steamers. It is united to the village
of Lanvallay on the right bank of the river by a granite viaduct
130 ft. in height. The town is almost entirely encircled by the
ramparts of the middle ages, strengthened at intervals by towers
and defended on the south by a castle of the late 14th century,
which now serves as prison. Three old gateways are also preserved.
Dinan has two interesting churches; that of St Malo, of
late Gothic architecture, and St Sauveur, in which the Romanesque
and Gothic styles are intermingled. In the latter church a
granite monument contains the heart of Bertrand Du Guesclin,
whose connexion with the town is also commemorated by an
equestrian statue. The quaint winding streets of Dinan are often
bordered by medieval houses. Its picturesqueness attracts large
numbers of visitors and there are many English residents in the
town and its vicinity. About three-quarters of a mile from the
town are the ruins of the château and the Benedictine abbey at
Léhon; near the neighbouring village of St Esprit stands the
large lunatic asylum of Les Bas Foins, founded in 1836; and at
no great distance is the now dismantled château of La Garaye,
which was rendered famous in the 18th century by the philanthropic
devotion of the count and countess whose story is told
in Mrs Norton&rsquo;s <i>Lady of La Garaye</i>. Dinan is the seat of a subprefect
and has a tribunal of first instance, and a communal
college. There is trade in grain, cider, wax, butter and other
agricultural products. The industries include the manufacture
of leather, farm-implements and canvas.</p>

<p>The principal event in the history of Dinan, which was a stronghold
of the dukes of Brittany, is the siege by the English under the
duke of Lancaster in 1359, during which Du Guesclin and an
English knight called Thomas of Canterbury engaged in single
combat.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DINANT,<a name="ar121" id="ar121"></a></span> an ancient town on the right bank of the Meuse in
the province of Namur, Belgium, connected by a bridge with the
left bank, on which are the station and the suburb of St Medard.
Pop. (1904) 7674. The name is supposed to be derived from
Diana, and as early as the 7th century it was named as one of the
dependencies of the bishopric of Tongres. In the 10th century it
passed under the titular sway of Liége, and remained the fief of the
prince-bishopric till the French revolution put an end to that
survival of feudalism. In the middle of the 15th century Dinant
reached the height of its prosperity. With a population of
60,000, and 8000 workers in copper, it was one of the most
flourishing cities in Walloon Belgium, until it incurred the wrath
of Charles the Bold. Belief in the strength of its walls and of the
castle that occupied the centre bridge, thus effectually commanding
navigation by the river, engendered arrogance and overconfidence,
and the people of Dinant thought they could defy the
full power of Burgundy. Perhaps they also expected aid from France or Liége. In 1466 Charles, in his father&rsquo;s name, laid siege
to Dinant, and on the 27th of August carried the place by storm.
He razed the walls and allowed the women, children and priests
to retire in safety to Liége, but the male prisoners he either
hanged or drowned in the river by causing them to be cast from
the projecting cliff of Bouvignes. In 1675 the capture of Dinant
formed one of the early military achievements of Louis XIV., and
it remained in the hands of the French for nearly thirty years
after that date. The citadel on the cliff, 300 ft. or 408 steps above
the town, was fortified by the Dutch in 1818. It is now dismantled,
but forms the chief curiosity of the place. The views
of the river valley from this eminence are exceedingly fine. Half
way up the cliff, but some distance south of the citadel, is the
grotto of Montfat, alleged to be the site of Diana&rsquo;s shrine. The
church of Notre Dame, dating from the 13th century, stands
immediately under the citadel and flanking the bridge. It has
been restored, and is considered by some authorities, although
others make the same claim on behalf of Huy, the most complete
specimen in Belgium of pointed Gothic architecture. The
baptismal fonts date from the 12th century, and the curious spire
in the form of an elongated pumpkin and covered with slates
gives a fantastic and original appearance to the whole edifice.
The present prosperity of Dinant is chiefly derived from its being
a favourite summer resort for Belgians as well as foreigners. It
has facilities for beating and bathing as well as for trips by
steamer up and down the river Meuse. It is also a convenient
central point for excursions into the Ardennes. Although there
are some indications of increased industrial activity in recent
years, the population of Dinant is not one-eighth of what it was
at the time of the Burgundians.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DINAPUR,<a name="ar122" id="ar122"></a></span> a town and military station of British India, in the
Patna district of Bengal, on the right bank of the Ganges, 12 m.
W. of Patna city by rail. Pop. (1901) 33,699. It is the largest
military cantonment in Bengal, with accommodation for two
batteries of artillery, a European and a native infantry regiment.
In 1857 the sepoy garrison of the place initiated the mutiny of
that year in Patna district, but after a conflict with the European
troops were forced to retire from the town, and subsequently laid
siege to Arrah.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DINARCHUS,<a name="ar123" id="ar123"></a></span> last of the &ldquo;ten&rdquo; Attic orators, son of Sostratus
(or, according to Suidas, Socrates), born at Corinth about 361
<span class="sc">b.c.</span> He settled at Athens early in life, and when not more than
twenty-five was already active as a writer of speeches for the law
courts. As an alien, he was unable to take part in the debates.
He had been the pupil both of Theophrastus and of Demetrius
Phalereus, and had early acquired a certain fluency and versatility
of style. In 324 the Areopagus, after inquiry, reported
that nine men had taken bribes from Harpalus, the fugitive
treasurer of Alexander. Ten public prosecutors were appointed.
Dinarchus wrote, for one or more of these prosecutors, the three
speeches which are still extant&mdash;<i>Against Demosthenes</i>, <i>Against
Aristogeiton</i>, <i>Against Philocles</i>. The sympathies of Dinarchus
were in favour of an Athenian oligarchy under Macedonian
control; but it should be remembered that he was not an
Athenian citizen. Aeschines and Demades had no such excuse.
In the Harpalus affair, Demosthenes was doubtless innocent,
and so, probably, were others of the accused. Yet Hypereides,
the most fiery of the patriots, was on the same side as Dinarchus.</p>

<p>Under the regency of his old master, Demetrius Phalereus,
Dinarchus exercised much political influence. The years 317-307
were the most prosperous of his life. On the fall of Demetrius
Phalereus and the restoration of the democracy by Demetrius
Poliorcetes, Dinarchus was condemned to death and withdrew
into exile at Chalcis in Euboea. About 292, thanks to his friend
Theophrastus, he was able to return to Attica, and took up his
abode in the country with a former associate, Proxenus. He
afterwards brought an action against Proxenus on the ground
that he had robbed him of some money and plate. Dinarchus
died at Athens about 291.</p>

<p>According to Suidas, Dinarchus wrote 160 speeches; and Dionysius held
that, out of 85 extant speeches bearing his name, 58 were genuine,&mdash;28
relating to public, 30 to private causes. Although the authenticity of
the three speeches mentioned above is generally admitted, Demetrius of
Magnesia doubted that of the speech <i>Against Demosthenes</i>, while A.
Westermann rejected all three. Dinarchus had little individual style and
imitated by turns Lysias, Hypereides and Demosthenes. He is called by
Hermogenes <span class="grk" title="o critinos demostenes">&#8001; &#954;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#953;&#957;&#8056;&#962; &#916;&#951;&#956;&#959;&#963;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#951;&#962;</span>, a metaphor taken from barley compared
with wheat, or beer compared with wine,&mdash;a Demosthenes whose strength
is rougher, without flavour or sparkle.</p>
